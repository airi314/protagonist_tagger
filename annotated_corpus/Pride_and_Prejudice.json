However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be       on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well       fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is       considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their       daughters. My dear Mr. Bennet, said his lady to him one day, have you       heard that Netherfield Park is let at last? Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. But it is, returned she; for Mrs. Long has just been here, and       she told me all about it. Mr. Bennet made no answer. Do not you want to know who has taken it? cried his wife       impatiently. _You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it. This was invitation enough. Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is       taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;       that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the       place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.       Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before       Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by       the end of next week. What is his name? Bingley. Is he married or single? Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;       four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls! How so? how can it affect them? My dear Mr. Bennet, replied his wife, how can you be so       tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of       them. Is that his design in settling here? Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely       that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you       must visit him as soon as he comes. I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may       send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for       as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you       the best of the party. My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of       beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.       When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over       thinking of her own beauty. In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of. But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he       comes into the neighbourhood. It is more than I engage for, I assure you. But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it       would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are       determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you       know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be       impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not. You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be       very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to       assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he       chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my       little Lizzy. I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better       than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as       Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always       giving _her_ the preference. They have none of them much to recommend them, replied he;       they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has       something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?       You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor       nerves. You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.       They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with       consideration these twenty years at least. Ah, you do not know what I suffer. But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men       of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood. It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you       will not visit them. Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will       visit them all. Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,       reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty       years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his       character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a       woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain       temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.       The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its       solace was visiting and news.  Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.       Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last       always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the       evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It       was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second       daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her       with, I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy. We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes, said her       mother resentfully, since we are not to visit. But you forget, mamma, said Elizabeth, that we shall meet him       at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him. I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two       nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I       have no opinion of her. No more have I, said Mr. Bennet; and I am glad to find that       you do not depend on her serving you. Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain       herself, began scolding one of her daughters. Dont keep coughing so, Kitty, for heavens sake! Have a little       compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces. Kitty has no discretion in her coughs, said her father; she       times them ill. I do not cough for my own amusement, replied Kitty fretfully.       When is your next ball to be, Lizzy? To-morrow fortnight. Aye, so it is, cried her mother, and Mrs. Long does not come       back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to       introduce him, for she will not know him herself. Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and       introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_. Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted       with him myself; how can you be so teasing? I honour your circumspection. A fortnights acquaintance is       certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by       the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else       will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their       chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,       if you decline the office, I will take it on myself. The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,       Nonsense, nonsense! What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation? cried he.       Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that       is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you       _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep       reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts. Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how. While Mary is adjusting her ideas, he continued, let us return       to Mr. Bingley. I am sick of Mr. Bingley, cried his wife. I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so       before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not       have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually       paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now. The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of       Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first       tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she       had expected all the while. How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should       persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to       neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is       such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and       never said a word about it till now. Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose, said Mr.       Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the       raptures of his wife. What an excellent father you have, girls, said she, when the       door was shut. I do not know how you will ever make him amends       for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of       life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new       acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do       anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare       say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball. Oh! said Lydia stoutly, I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the       youngest, Im the tallest. The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he       would return Mr. Bennets visit, and determining when they should       ask him to dinner.  Chapter 3\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her       five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw       from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.       They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,       ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the       skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the       second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her       report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with       him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely       agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next       assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To       be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;       and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingleys heart were entertained. If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at       Netherfield, said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, and all the       others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for. In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennets visit, and sat       about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained       hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose       beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies       were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of       ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and       rode a black horse. An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and       already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do       credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred       it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,       and consequently unable to accept the honour of their       invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could       not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his       arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be       always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a       little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to       get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that       Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with       him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of       ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,       that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from       London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered       the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another       young man. Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine       women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.       Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon       drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome       features, noble mien, and the report which was in general       circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having       ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine       figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than       Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned       the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to       be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his       large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most       forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be       compared with his friend. Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the       principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,       danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and       talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable       qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him       and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and       once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the       room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His       character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man       in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there       again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,       whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into       particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters. Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,       to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.       Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a       conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance       for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it. Come, Darcy, said he, I must have you dance. I hate to see you       standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much       better dance. I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am       particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as       this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and       there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a       punishment to me to stand up with. I would not be so fastidious as you are, cried Bingley,       for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant       girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of       them you see uncommonly pretty. _You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room, said       Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there       is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very       pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner       to introduce you. Which do you mean? and turning round, he looked for a moment at       Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly       said, She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I       am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies       who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your       partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with       me. Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and       Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She       told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for       she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in       anything ridiculous. The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.       Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the       Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she       had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified       by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.       Elizabeth felt Janes pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned       to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough       to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet       learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good       spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which       they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still       up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present       occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an       evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had       rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be       disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story       to hear. Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet, as she entered the room, we have had a       most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had       been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.       Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her       quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,       my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only       creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,       he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;       but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,       you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going       down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,       and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with       Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth       with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the       _Boulanger_ If he had had any compassion for _me_, cried her husband       impatiently, he would not have danced half so much! For Gods       sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his       ankle in the first dance! Oh! my dear, continued Mrs. Bennet, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively       handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life       saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace       upon Mrs. Hursts gown Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any       description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another       branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of       spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\nBut I can assure you, she added, that Lizzy does not lose much       by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid       man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that       there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,       fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance       with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one       of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.  Chapter 4 When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been       cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her       sister how very much she admired him. He is just what a young man ought to be, said she, sensible,       good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!so       much ease, with such perfect good breeding! He is also handsome, replied Elizabeth, which a young man       ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is       thereby complete. I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second       time. I did not expect such a compliment. Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference       between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_       never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He       could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as       every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for       that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave       to like him. You have liked many a stupider person. Dear Lizzy! Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in       general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good       and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a       human being in my life. I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always       speak what I think. I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With       _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and       nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;one       meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or       designto take the good of everybodys character and make it       still better, and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone.       And so, you like this mans sisters, too, do you? Their manners       are not equal to his. Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when       you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,       and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a       very charming neighbour in her. Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their       behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in       general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy       of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by       any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve       them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good       humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of       being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.       They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first       private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand       pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and       of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every       respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of       others. They were of a respectable family in the north of       England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories       than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired       by trade. Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred       thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an       estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it       likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was       now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was       doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his       temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at       Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own;       but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley       was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.       Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less       disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.       Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by       an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did       look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the       situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner       said in its praise, and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in       spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to       Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,       though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,       and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the       strength of Darcys regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and       of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was       the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was       clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.       In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was       sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually       giving offence. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was       sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with       pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been       most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no       stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as       to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.       Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom       there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had       felt the smallest interest, and from none received either       attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,       but she smiled too much. Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they       admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,       and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet       was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt       authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.  Chapter 5 Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the       Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been       formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable       fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to       the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been       felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business       and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting       them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile       from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he       could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled       by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the       world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him       supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.       By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation       at St. Jamess had made him courteous. Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a       valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The       eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about       twenty-seven, was Elizabeths intimate friend. That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk       over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the       assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to       communicate. _You_ began the evening well, Charlotte, said Mrs. Bennet with       civil self-command to Miss Lucas. _You_ were Mr. Bingleys first       choice. Yes; but he seemed to like his second better. Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.       To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired herindeed I rather       believe he _did_I heard something about itbut I hardly know       whatsomething about Mr. Robinson. Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;       did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinsons asking him how he       liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there       were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he       thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last       questionOh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt, there       cannot be two opinions on that point. Upon my word! Well, that was very decided indeedthat does seem       as ifbut, however, it may all come to nothing, you know. _My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,       said Charlotte. Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as       his friend, is he?Poor Eliza!to be only just _tolerable_. I beg you would not put it into Lizzys head to be vexed by his       ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would       be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last       night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once       opening his lips. Are you quite sure, maam?is not there a little mistake? said       Jane. I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\nAyebecause she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and       he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very       angry at being spoke to. Miss Bingley told me, said Jane, that he never speaks much       unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is       remarkably agreeable. I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very       agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how       it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare       say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,       and had come to the ball in a hack chaise. I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long, said Miss Lucas,       but I wish he had danced with Eliza. Another time, Lizzy, said her mother, I would not dance with       _him_, if I were you. I believe, maam, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with       him. His pride, said Miss Lucas, does not offend _me_ so much as       pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot       wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,       everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I       may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud. That is very true, replied Elizabeth, and I could easily       forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_. Pride, observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of       her reflections, is a very common failing, I believe. By all       that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common       indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that       there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of       self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or       imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the       words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without       being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,       vanity to what we would have others think of us. If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy, cried a young Lucas, who came       with his sisters, I should not care how proud I was. I would       keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day. Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought, said       Mrs. Bennet; and if I were to see you at it, I should take away       your bottle directly. The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare       that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.  Chapter 6 The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The       visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennets pleasing       manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and       though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger       sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted       with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this       attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth       still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,       hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though       their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in       all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration.       It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire       her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to       the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the       first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she       considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered       by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength       of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of       manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas. It may perhaps be pleasant, replied Charlotte, to be able to       impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a       disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her       affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose       the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor       consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so       much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it       is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freelya       slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us       who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.       In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection       than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may       never do more than like her, if she does not help him on. But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If       _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton       indeed not to discover it too. Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Janes disposition as you       do. But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to       conceal it, he must find it out. Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley       and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours       together; and as they always see each other in large mixed       parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in       conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every       half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is       secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as       much as she chooses. Your plan is a good one, replied Elizabeth, where nothing is       in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were       determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I       should adopt it. But these are not Janes feelings; she is not       acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the       degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known       him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;       she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined       in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make       her understand his character. Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she       might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but       you must remember that four evenings have been also spent       togetherand four evenings may do a great deal. Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that       they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to       any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has       been unfolded. Well, said Charlotte, I wish Jane success with all my heart;       and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had       as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his       character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a       matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so       well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does       not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to       grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of       vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the       defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life. You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it       is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself. Occupied in observing Mr. Bingleys attentions to her sister,       Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming       an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy       had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at       her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he       looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it       clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good       feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark       eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.       Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure       of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her       figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting       that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was       caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly       unaware;to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable       nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance       with. He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards       conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with       others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William       Lucass, where a large party were assembled. What does Mr. Darcy mean, said she to Charlotte, by listening       to my conversation with Colonel Forster? That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer. But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I       see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do       not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid       of him. On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming       to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend       to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking       Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly       well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a       ball at Meryton? With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady       energetic. You are severe on us. It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased, said Miss Lucas. I am       going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\nYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!always       wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my       vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;       but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who       must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers. On       Miss Lucass persevering, however, she added, Very well; if it       must be so, it must. And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, There       is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar       withKeep your breath to cool your porridge,and I shall keep       mine to swell my song. Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a       song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of       several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at       the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of       being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge       and accomplishments, was always impatient for display. Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given       her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and       conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of       excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,       had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing       half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad       to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the       request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases,       and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end       of the room. Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of       passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and       was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir       William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began. What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!       There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of       the first refinements of polished societies. Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue       amongst the less polished societies of the world.Every savage       can dance. Sir William only smiled. Your friend performs delightfully, he       continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; and I       doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.       Darcy. You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir. Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the       sight. Do you often dance at St. Jamess? Never, sir. Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place? It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid       it. You have a house in town, I conclude? Mr. Darcy bowed. I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselffor I am       fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that       the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas. He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not       disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving       towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very       gallant thing, and called out to her, My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must       allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable       partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much       beauty is before you. And, taking her hand, he would have given       it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not       unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said       with some discomposure to Sir William, Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I       entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg       for a partner. Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the       honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor       did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at       persuasion. You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to       deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman       dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am       sure, to oblige us for one half-hour. Mr. Darcy is all politeness, said Elizabeth, smiling. He is, indeedbut, considering the inducement, my dear Miss       Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object       to such a partner? Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not       injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with       some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley, I can guess the subject of your reverie. I should imagine not. You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many       evenings in this mannerin such society; and indeed I am quite of       your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet       the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all       these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them! Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more       agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great       pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman       can bestow. Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired       he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such       reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity, Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Miss Elizabeth Bennet! repeated Miss Bingley. I am all       astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?and pray       when am I to wish you joy? That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A       ladys imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to       love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be       wishing me joy. Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as       absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,       indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with       you. He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to       entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced       her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.  Chapter 7 Mr. Bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of       two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was       entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and       their mothers fortune, though ample for her situation in life,       could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been       an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk       to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother       settled in London in a respectable line of trade. The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most       convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually       tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to       their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way. The two       youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly       frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than       their sisters, and when nothing better offered, a walk to       Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish       conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the       country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some       from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both       with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia       regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,       and Meryton was the headquarters. Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most       interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their       knowledge of the officers names and connections. Their lodgings       were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the       officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this       opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They       could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingleys large       fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was       worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an       ensign. After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,       Mr. Bennet coolly observed, From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must       be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it       some time, but I am now convinced. Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with       perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of       Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the       day, as he was going the next morning to London. I am astonished, my dear, said Mrs. Bennet, that you should be       so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think       slightingly of anybodys children, it should not be of my own,       however. If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of       it. Yesbut as it happens, they are all of them very clever. This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not       agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every       particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two       youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.\nMy dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the       sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I       dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.       I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very welland,       indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,       with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I       shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked       very becoming the other night at Sir Williams in his       regimentals. Mamma, cried Lydia, my aunt says that Colonel Forster and       Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watsons as they did       when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in       Clarkes library. Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman       with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the       servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennets eyes sparkled with       pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter       read, Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?       Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love. It is from Miss Bingley, said Jane, and then read it aloud. MY DEAR FRIEND,       If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa       and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest       of our lives, for a whole days _tte--tte_ between two women       can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the       receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with       the officers.Yours ever, CAROLINE BINGLEY With the officers! cried Lydia. I wonder my aunt did not tell       us of _that_. Dining out, said Mrs. Bennet, that is very unlucky. Can I have the carriage? said Jane. No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems       likely to rain; and then you must stay all night. That would be a good scheme, said Elizabeth, if you were sure       that they would not offer to send her home. Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingleys chaise to go to       Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs. I had much rather go in the coach. But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.       They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they? They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them. But if you have got them to-day, said Elizabeth, my mothers       purpose will be answered. She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the       horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on       horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many       cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane       had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were       uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued       the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not       come back. This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed! said Mrs. Bennet, more       than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.       Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the       felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a       servant from Netherfield brought the following note for       Elizabeth: MY DEAREST LIZZY,       I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to       be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends       will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also       on my seeing Mr. Jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should       hear of his having been to meand, excepting a sore throat and       headache, there is not much the matter with me.Yours, &c. Well, my dear, said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the       note aloud, if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of       illnessif she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it       was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders. Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little       trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she       stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I       could have the carriage. Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,       though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no       horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her       resolution. How can you be so silly, cried her mother, as to think of such       a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when       you get there. I shall be very fit to see Janewhich is all I want. Is this a hint to me, Lizzy, said her father, to send for the       horses? No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is       nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back       by dinner. I admire the activity of your benevolence, observed Mary, but       every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my       opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is       required. We will go as far as Meryton with you, said Catherine and       Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young       ladies set off together. If we make haste, said Lydia, as they walked along, perhaps we       may see something of Captain Carter before he goes. In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings       of one of the officers wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk       alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over       stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and       finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary       ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of       exercise. She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were       assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of       surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the       day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible       to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that       they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very       politely by them; and in their brothers manners there was       something better than politeness; there was good humour and       kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at       all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy       which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the       occasions justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was       thinking only of his breakfast. Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.       Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and       not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken       to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the       fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note       how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her       entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and       when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little       beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness       she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her. When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and       Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much       affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary       came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be       supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must       endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,       and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,       for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.       Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other       ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact       nothing to do elsewhere. When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and       very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,       and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane       testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was       obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to       remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully       consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint       the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.  Chapter 8 At five oclock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past       six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries       which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of       distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingleys, she       could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means       better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four       times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a       bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;       and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference       towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth       to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she       could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was       evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they       prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed       she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from       any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister       scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he       was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at       cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,       had nothing to say to her. When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss       Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her       manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride       and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.       Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added, She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an       excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this       morning. She really looked almost wild. She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.       Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering       about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so       untidy, so blowsy! Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches       deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been       let down to hide it not doing its office. Your picture may be very exact, Louisa, said Bingley; but this       was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked       remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her       dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice. _You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure, said Miss Bingley;       and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your       sister_ make such an exhibition. Certainly not. To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever       it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what       could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort       of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to       decorum. It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,       said Bingley. I am afraid, Mr. Darcy, observed Miss Bingley, in a half       whisper, that this adventure has rather affected your admiration       of her fine eyes. Not at all, he replied; they were brightened by the exercise.       A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again. I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a       very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well       settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low       connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it. I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in       Meryton. Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside. That is capital, added her sister, and they both laughed       heartily. If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside, cried       Bingley, it would not make them one jot less agreeable. But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men       of any consideration in the world, replied Darcy. To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it       their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at       the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations. With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room       on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to       coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit       her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of       seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than       pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the       drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was       immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be       playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse,       said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay       below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment. Do you prefer reading to cards? said he; that is rather       singular. Miss Eliza Bennet, said Miss Bingley, despises cards. She is a       great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else. I deserve neither such praise nor such censure, cried       Elizabeth; I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in       many things. In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure, said       Bingley; and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her       quite well. Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a       table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to       fetch her others; all that his library afforded. And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own       credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I       have more than I ever looked into. Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with       those in the room. I am astonished, said Miss Bingley, that my father should have       left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library       you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy! It ought to be good, he replied, it has been the work of many       generations. And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always       buying books. I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days       as these. Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the       beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_       house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley. I wish it may. But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that       neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is       not a finer county in England than Derbyshire. With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will       sell it. I am talking of possibilities, Charles. Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get       Pemberley by purchase than by imitation. Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her       very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly       aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself       between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game. Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring? said Miss Bingley;       will she be as tall as I am? I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennets       height, or rather taller. How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who       delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners!and so       extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the       pianoforte is exquisite. It is amazing to me, said Bingley, how young ladies can have       patience to be so very accomplished as they all are. All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you       mean? Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens,       and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this,       and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first       time, without being informed that she was very accomplished. Your list of the common extent of accomplishments, said Darcy,       has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who       deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a       screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your       estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more       than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that       are really accomplished. Nor I, I am sure, said Miss Bingley. Then, observed Elizabeth, you must comprehend a great deal in       your idea of an accomplished woman. Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it. Oh! certainly, cried his faithful assistant, no one can be       really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is       usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of       music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to       deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a       certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of       her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but       half deserved. All this she must possess, added Darcy, and to all this she       must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of       her mind by extensive reading. I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished       women. I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_. Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility       of all this? _I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and       taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice       of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew       many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called       them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to       what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an       end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. Eliza Bennet, said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed       on her, is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend       themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with       many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a       paltry device, a very mean art. Undoubtedly, replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly       addressed, there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies       sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears       affinity to cunning is despicable. Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to       continue the subject.\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was       worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Joness       being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no       country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to       town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not       hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their       brothers proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be       sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly       better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared       that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,       however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better       relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions       that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her       sister.  Chapter 9 Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room, and       in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable       answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.       Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two       elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this       amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to       Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own       judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched,       and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet,       accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon       after the family breakfast. Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have       been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her       illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering       immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove       her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her       daughters proposal of being carried home; neither did the       apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all       advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss       Bingleys appearance and invitation, the mother and three       daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley       met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet       worse than she expected. Indeed I have, sir, was her answer. She is a great deal too       ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.       We must trespass a little longer on your kindness. Removed! cried Bingley. It must not be thought of. My sister,       I am sure, will not hear of her removal. You may depend upon it, Madam, said Miss Bingley, with cold       civility, that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention       while she remains with us. Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. I am sure, she added, if it was not for such good friends I do       not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,       and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the       world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without       exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell       my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room       here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.       I do not know a place in the country that is equal to       Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I       hope, though you have but a short lease. Whatever I do is done in a hurry, replied he; and therefore if       I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in       five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite       fixed here. That is exactly what I should have supposed of you, said       Elizabeth. You begin to comprehend me, do you? cried he, turning towards       her. Oh! yesI understand you perfectly. I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily       seen through I am afraid is pitiful. That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate       character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours. Lizzy, cried her mother, remember where you are, and do not       run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home. I did not know before, continued Bingley immediately, that you       were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study. Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have       at least that advantage. The country, said Darcy, can in general supply but few       subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in       a very confined and unvarying society. But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new       to be observed in them for ever. Yes, indeed, cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of       mentioning a country neighbourhood. I assure you there is quite       as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town. Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a       moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had       gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph. I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the       country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The       country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley? When I am in the country, he replied, I never wish to leave       it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have       each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either. Ayethat is because you have the right disposition. But that       gentleman, looking at Darcy, seemed to think the country was       nothing at all. Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken, said Elizabeth, blushing for       her mother. You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that       there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the       country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true. Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not       meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there       are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with       four-and-twenty families. Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep       his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her       eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth,       for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers       thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn       since _her_ coming away. Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man       Sir William is, Mr. Bingleyis not he? so much the man of       fashion! So genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to       everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons       who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths,       quite mistake the matter. Did Charlotte dine with you? No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the       mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants       that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up       differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the       Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity       they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_       plainbut then she is our particular friend. She seems a very pleasant young woman, said Bingley. Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas       herself has often said so, and envied me Janes beauty. I do not       like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Janeone does not       often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do       not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was       a gentleman at my brother Gardiners in town so much in love with her,       that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before       we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her       too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty       they were. And so ended his affection, said Elizabeth impatiently. There       has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder       who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away       love! I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love, said       Darcy. Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what       is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of       inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it       entirely away. Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made       Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself       again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;       and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks       to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for       troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil       in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,       and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed       without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and       soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the       youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had       been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the       result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with       having promised on his first coming into the country to give a       ball at Netherfield.\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine       complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her       mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early       age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural       self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom       her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended       her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore,       to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly       reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most       shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to       this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear. I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and       when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the       very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while       she is ill. Lydia declared herself satisfied. Oh! yesit would be much       better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely       Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given       _your_ ball, she added, I shall insist on their giving one       also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he       does not. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth       returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations       behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the       latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in       their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingleys witticisms       on _fine eyes_.  Chapter 10 The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and       Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the       invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the       evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The       loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and       Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his       letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to       his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.       Hurst was observing their game. Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in       attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The       perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting,       or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter,       with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received,       formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her       opinion of each. How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter! He made no answer. You write uncommonly fast. You are mistaken. I write rather slowly. How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course       of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think       them! It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to       yours. Pray tell your sister that I long to see her. I have already told her so once, by your desire. I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I       mend pens remarkably well. Thank youbut I always mend my own. How can you contrive to write so even? He was silent. Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on       the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with       her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it       infinitely superior to Miss Grantleys. Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write       again? At present I have not room to do them justice. Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do       you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy? They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not       for me to determine. It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter       with ease, cannot write ill. That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline, cried her       brother, because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too       much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy? My style of writing is very different from yours. Oh! cried Miss Bingley, Charles writes in the most careless       way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the       rest. My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express themby       which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my       correspondents. Your humility, Mr. Bingley, said Elizabeth, must disarm       reproof. Nothing is more deceitful, said Darcy, than the appearance of       humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes       an indirect boast. And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of       modesty? The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in       writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity       of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not       estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of       doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the       possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of       the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if       you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in       five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of       compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in       a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone,       and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else? Nay, cried Bingley, this is too much, to remember at night all       the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon       my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I       believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume       the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before       the ladies. I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that       you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite       as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you       were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, Bingley, you had       better stay till next week, you would probably do it, you would       probably not goand, at another word, might stay a month. You have only proved by this, cried Elizabeth, that Mr.       Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown       him off now much more than he did himself. I am exceedingly gratified, said Bingley, by your converting       what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my       temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that       gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think       the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat       denial, and ride off as fast as I could. Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original       intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it? Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must       speak for himself. You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call       mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case,       however, to stand according to your representation, you must       remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire       his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely       desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of       its propriety. To yield readilyeasilyto the _persuasion_ of a friend is no       merit with you. To yield without conviction is no compliment to the       understanding of either. You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence       of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would       often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for       arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking       of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as       well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we       discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general       and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them       is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great       moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with       the desire, without waiting to be argued into it? Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to       arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which       is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of       intimacy subsisting between the parties? By all means, cried Bingley; let us hear all the particulars,       not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will       have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be       aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall       fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so       much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than       Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his       own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has       nothing to do. Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that       he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss       Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an       expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. I see your design, Bingley, said his friend. You dislike an       argument, and want to silence this. Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and       Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall       be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\nWhat you ask, said Elizabeth, is no sacrifice on my side; and       Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter. Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter. When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and       Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved       with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request       that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and       more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus       employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over       some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.       Darcys eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose       that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and       yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still       more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last, that she       drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and       reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other       person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him       too little to care for his approbation. After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm       by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing       near Elizabeth, said to her Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such       an opportunity of dancing a reel? She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with       some surprise at her silence. Oh! said she, I heard you before; but I could not immediately       determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say       Yes, that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;       but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and       cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have,       therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to       dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare. Indeed I do not dare. Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at       his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness       in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;       and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by       her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of       her connections, he should be in some danger. Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her       great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received       some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth. She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by       talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in       such an alliance. I hope, said she, as they were walking together in the       shrubbery the next day, you will give your mother-in-law a few       hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage       of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the       younger girls of running after the officers. And, if I may mention so       delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,       bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady       possesses. Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity? Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be       placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your       great uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know,       only in different lines. As for your Elizabeths picture, you       must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to       those beautiful eyes? It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but       their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,       might be copied. At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and       Elizabeth herself. I did not know that you intended to walk, said Miss Bingley, in       some confusion, lest they had been overheard. You used us abominably ill, answered Mrs. Hurst, running away       without telling us that you were coming out. Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth       to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt       their rudeness, and immediately said, This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go       into the avenue. But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with       them, laughingly answered, No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and       appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by       admitting a fourth. Good-bye. She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the       hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so       much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of       hours that evening.  Chapter 11 When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her       sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into       the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with       many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them       so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the       gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were       considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy,       relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance       with spirit. But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first       object; Miss Bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,       and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many       steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite       congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he       was very glad; but diffuseness and warmth remained for       Bingleys salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first       half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer       from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the       other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the       door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone       else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with       great delight. When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the       card-tablebut in vain. She had obtained private intelligence       that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found       even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one       intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the       subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to       do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.       Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,       principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings,       joined now and then in her brothers conversation with Miss       Bennet. Miss Bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching       Mr. Darcys progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own;       and she was perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at       his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he       merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite       exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which       she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she       gave a great yawn and said, How pleasant it is to spend an       evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment       like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a       book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I       have not an excellent library. No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her       book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some       amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss       Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a       dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on       it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much       mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be       rather a punishment than a pleasure. If you mean Darcy, cried her brother, he may go to bed, if he       chooses, before it beginsbut as for the ball, it is quite a       settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup       enough, I shall send round my cards. I should like balls infinitely better, she replied, if they       were carried on in a different manner; but there is something       insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It       would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of       dancing were made the order of the day. Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would       not be near so much like a ball. Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and       walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked       well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly       studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one       effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said: Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and       take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing       after sitting so long in one attitude.\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss       Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.       Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention       in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously       closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but       he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives       for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with       either of which motives his joining them would interfere. What       could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his       meaning?and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand       him? Not at all, was her answer; but depend upon it, he means to be       severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to       ask nothing about it. Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy       in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation       of his two motives. I have not the smallest objection to explaining them, said he,       as soon as she allowed him to speak. You either choose this       method of passing the evening because you are in each others       confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you       are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage       in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and       if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the       fire. Oh! shocking! cried Miss Bingley. I never heard anything so       abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech? Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination, said       Elizabeth. We can all plague and punish one another. Tease       himlaugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to       be done. But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy       has not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and       presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to       laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by       attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug       himself. Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at! cried Elizabeth. That is an       uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it       would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I       dearly love a laugh. Miss Bingley, said he, has given me more credit than can be.       The wisest and the best of mennay, the wisest and best of their       actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object       in life is a joke. Certainly, replied Elizabeththere are such people, but I hope       I am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and       good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_       divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,       I suppose, are precisely what you are without. Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the       study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a       strong understanding to ridicule. Such as vanity and pride. Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pridewhere there is a       real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good       regulation. Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume, said Miss       Bingley; and pray what is the result? I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He       owns it himself without disguise. No, said Darcy, I have made no such pretension. I have faults       enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I       dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little       yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world. I       cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought,       nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed       about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be       called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever. _That_ is a failing indeed! cried Elizabeth. Implacable       resentment _is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your       fault well. I really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me. There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some       particular evila natural defect, which not even the best       education can overcome. And _your_ defect is to hate everybody. And yours, he replied with a smile, is willfully to       misunderstand them. Do let us have a little music, cried Miss Bingley, tired of a       conversation in which she had no share. Louisa, you will not       mind my waking Mr. Hurst? Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was       opened; and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not       sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too       much attention.  Chapter 12 In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth       wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage       might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet,       who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till       the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Janes week,       could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her       answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to       Elizabeths wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.       Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the       carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that       if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she       could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however,       Elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it       would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered       as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow       Mr. Bingleys carriage immediately, and at length it was settled       that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning       should be mentioned, and the request made. The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough       was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day       to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.       Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for       her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her       affection for the other. The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to       go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it       would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered; but       Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right. To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligenceElizabeth had been at       Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he likedand       Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to       himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no       sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could       elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible       that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the       last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.       Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through       the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by       themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to       his book, and would not even look at her. On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to       almost all, took place. Miss Bingleys civility to Elizabeth       increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for       Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the       pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn       or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook       hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in       the liveliest of spirits. They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.       Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to       give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold       again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions       of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their       importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when       they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and       almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth. They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and       human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new       observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and       Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been       done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding       Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their       uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been       hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.  Chapter 13 I hope, my dear, said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at       breakfast the next morning, that you have ordered a good dinner       to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family       party. Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am       sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call inand I hope       _my_ dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often       sees such at home. The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger. Mrs. Bennets eyes sparkled. A gentleman and a stranger! It is       Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad       to see Mr. Bingley. Butgood Lord! how unlucky! There is not a       bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bellI       must speak to Hill this moment.\nIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley, said her husband; it is a person whom       I never saw in the whole course of my life. This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of       being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at       once. After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus       explained: About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight       ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and       requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins,       who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon       as he pleases. Oh! my dear, cried his wife, I cannot bear to hear that       mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is       the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be       entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had       been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other       about it. Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an       entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a       subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and       she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an       estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man       whom nobody cared anything about. It certainly is a most iniquitous affair, said Mr. Bennet, and       nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting       Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps       be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself. No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very       impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.       I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling       with you, as his father did before him? Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on       that head, as you will hear. Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15_th October_. Dear Sir,       The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late       honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have       had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal       the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,       fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to       be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him       to be at variance.There, Mrs. Bennet.My mind, however, is now       made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter,       I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage       of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir       Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to       the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest       endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her       ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies       which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,       moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing       of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on       these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are       highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in       the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your       side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I       cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring       your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as       well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible       amendsbut of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to       receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of       waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four       oclock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the       Saturday seennight following, which I can do without any       inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my       occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other       clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.I remain, dear       sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your       well-wisher and friend, WILLIAM COLLINS At four oclock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making       gentleman, said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. He       seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my       word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,       especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him       come to us again. There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,       and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the       person to discourage him. Though it is difficult, said Jane, to guess in what way he can       mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is       certainly to his credit. Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for       Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,       and burying his parishioners whenever it were required. He must be an oddity, I think, said she. I cannot make him       out.There is something very pompous in his style.And what can       he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?We cannot       suppose he would help it if he could.Could he be a sensible man,       sir? No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him       quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and       self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am       impatient to see him. In point of composition, said Mary, the letter does not seem       defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly       new, yet I think it is well expressed. To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in       any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their       cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks       since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any       other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collinss letter had done       away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with       a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters. Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great       politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little;       but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed       neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent       himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of       five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners       were very formal. He had not been long seated before he       complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters;       said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance       fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not       doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.       This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers;       but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most       readily. You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it       may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are       settled so oddly. You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate. Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,       you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for       such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no       knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed. I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,       and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of       appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young       ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not       say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled       on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collinss       admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture,       were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything       would have touched Mrs. Bennets heart, but for the mortifying       supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The       dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know       to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was       owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him       with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good       cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He       begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she       declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to       apologise for about a quarter of an hour.  Chapter 14\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the       servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some       conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in       which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very       fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourghs attention       to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very       remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins       was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than       usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he       protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour       in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension, as he had       himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously       pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already       had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him       twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday       before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady       Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had       never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken       to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the       smallest objection to his joining in the society of the       neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a       week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to       advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with       discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble       parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations       he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some       herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs. That is all very proper and civil, I am sure, said Mrs. Bennet,       and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that       great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near       you, sir? The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by       a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyships residence. I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family? She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very       extensive property. Ah! said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, then she is better off       than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she       handsome? She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself       says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far       superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in       her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.       She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has       prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments       which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by       the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides       with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to       drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies. Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the       ladies at court. Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in       town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has       deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her       ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I       am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate       compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more       than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter       seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank,       instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These       are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it       is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound       to pay. You judge very properly, said Mr. Bennet, and it is happy for       you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May       I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse       of the moment, or are the result of previous study? They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though       I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such       little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary       occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as       possible. Mr. Bennets expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as       absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest       enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute       composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at       Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure. By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet       was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when       tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr.       Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on       beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a       circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,       protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and       Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some       deliberation he chose Fordyces Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened       the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity,       read three pages, she interrupted him with: Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away       Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt       told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow       to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from       town. Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but       Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said: I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by       books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their       benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be       nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no       longer importune my young cousin. Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist       at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that       he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling       amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly       for Lydias interruption, and promised that it should not occur       again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after       assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and       should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself       at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.  Chapter 15 Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature       had been but little assisted by education or society; the       greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of       an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one       of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms,       without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in       which his father had brought him up had given him originally       great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted       by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the       consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A       fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh       when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he       felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his       patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his       authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him       altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance       and humility. Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended       to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn       family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the       daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were       represented by common report. This was his plan of amendsof       atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate; and he thought it       an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and       excessively generous and disinterested on his own part. His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennets lovely face       confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of       what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was       his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an       alteration; for in a quarter of an hours _tte--tte_ with Mrs.       Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his       parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his       hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn,       produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general       encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.       As to her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to       sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not _know_ of any       prepossession; her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mentionshe       felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon       engaged. Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabethand it was       soon donedone while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.       Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded       her of course. Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might       soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not       bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.\nLydias intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every       sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to       attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious       to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither       Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would       continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the       collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little       cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings       discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been       always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as       he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other       room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his       civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to       join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact       much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely       pleased to close his large book, and go. In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his       cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The       attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by       _him_. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in       quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet       indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall       them. But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,       whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike       appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the       way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return       from London Lydia came to enquire, and he bowed as they passed.       All were struck with the strangers air, all wondered who he       could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find       out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting       something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained       the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached       the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated       permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned       with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had       accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it       should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him       completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he       had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good       figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed       up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness       at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole       party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,       when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley       were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of       the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and       began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,       and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on       his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her. Mr. Darcy       corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to       fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by       the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the       countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all       astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,       one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few       moments, touched his hata salutation which Mr. Darcy just       deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was       impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know. In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have       noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend. Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the       door of Mr. Phillips house, and then made their bows, in spite       of Miss Lydias pressing entreaties that they should come in, and       even in spite of Mrs. Phillipss throwing up the parlour window       and loudly seconding the invitation. Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two       eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and       she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return       home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she       should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see       Mr. Joness shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they       were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the       Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed       towards Mr. Collins by Janes introduction of him. She received       him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much       more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous       acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering       himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the       young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was       quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her       contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by       exclamations and enquiries about the other; of whom, however, she       could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny       had brought him from London, and that he was to have a       lieutenants commission in the shire. She had been watching him       the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and       had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have       continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now       except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the       stranger, were become stupid, disagreeable fellows. Some of       them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their       aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give       him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come       in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested       that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery       tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect       of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual       good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the       room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were       perfectly needless. As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen       pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have       defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong,       she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by       admiring Mrs. Phillipss manners and politeness. He protested       that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a       more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the       utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her       invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her       before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his       connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much       attention in the whole course of his life.  Chapter 16 As no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with       their aunt, and all Mr. Collinss scruples of leaving Mr. and       Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most       steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at       a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of       hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had       accepted their uncles invitation, and was then in the house. When this information was given, and they had all taken their       seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,       and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the       apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself       in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison       that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.       Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its       proprietorwhen she had listened to the description of only one       of Lady Catherines drawing-rooms, and found that the       chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all       the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a       comparison with the housekeepers room.\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her       mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble       abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily       employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.       Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his       consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving       to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To       the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had       nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their       own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the       interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last,       however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked       into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing       him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree       of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the shire were in       general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of       them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond       them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were       superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing       port wine, who followed them into the room. Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female       eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he       finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he       immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its       being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest,       most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill       of the speaker. With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and       the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to       the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at       intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her       watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.       When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of       obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist. I know little of the game at present, said he, but I shall be       glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life Mrs.       Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for       his reason. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he       received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first       there seemed danger of Lydias engrossing him entirely, for she       was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond       of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the       game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to       have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common       demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk       to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what       she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be toldthe       history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even       mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly       relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He enquired how       far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her       answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been       staying there. About a month, said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the       subject drop, added, He is a man of very large property in       Derbyshire, I understand. Yes, replied Mr. Wickham; his estate there is a noble one. A       clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a       person more capable of giving you certain information on that       head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a       particular manner from my infancy. Elizabeth could not but look surprised. You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,       after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our       meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy? As much as I ever wish to be, cried Elizabeth very warmly. I       have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him       very disagreeable. I have no right to give _my_ opinion, said Wickham, as to his       being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I       have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is       impossible for _me_ to be impartial. But I believe your opinion       of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not       express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your       own family. Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house       in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked       in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will       not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone. I cannot pretend to be sorry, said Wickham, after a short       interruption, that he or that any man should not be estimated       beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often       happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or       frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as       he chooses to be seen. I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an       ill-tempered man. Wickham only shook his head. I wonder, said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,       whether he is likely to be in this country much longer. I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away       when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the       shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood. Oh! noit is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If       _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on       friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I       have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim       before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most       painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet,       the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,       and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company       with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a       thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been       scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and       everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and       disgracing the memory of his father. Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and       listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented       further enquiry. Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the       neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all       that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but       very intelligible gallantry. It was the prospect of constant society, and good society, he       added, which was my chief inducement to enter the shire. I       knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend       Denny tempted me further by his account of their present       quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent       acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is       necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits       will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society. A       military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances       have now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my       professionI was brought up for the church, and I should at this       time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it       pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now. Indeed! Yesthe late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of       the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively       attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to       provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the       living fell, it was given elsewhere. Good heavens! cried Elizabeth; but how could _that_ be? How       could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal       redress? There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest       as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have       doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt itor to       treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert       that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,       imprudencein short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the       living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to       hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less       certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done       anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper,       and I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too       freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are       very different sort of men, and that he hates me. This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced. Some time or other he _will_ bebut it shall not be by _me_.       Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_. Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him       handsomer than ever as he expressed them. But what, said she, after a pause, can have been his motive?       What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\nA thorough, determined dislike of mea dislike which I cannot       but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy       liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his       fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very       early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of       competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was       often given me. I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as thisthough I have never       liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed       him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not       suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such       injustice, such inhumanity as this. After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, I _do_       remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the       implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving       temper. His disposition must be dreadful. I will not trust myself on the subject, replied Wickham; _I_       can hardly be just to him. Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,       To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite       of his father! She could have added, A young man, too, like       _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being       amiablebut she contented herself with, and one, too, who had       probably been his companion from childhood, connected together,       as I think you said, in the closest manner! We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the       greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the       same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same       parental care. _My_ father began life in the profession which       your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit tobut he       gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted       all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most       highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential       friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the       greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence, and       when, immediately before my fathers death, Mr. Darcy gave him a       voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he       felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his       affection to myself. How strange! cried Elizabeth. How abominable! I wonder that       the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If       from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to       be dishonestfor dishonesty I must call it. It _is_ wonderful, replied Wickham, for almost all his actions       may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.       It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other       feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour       to me there were stronger impulses even than pride. Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good? Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give       his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants,       and relieve the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pridefor he is       very proud of what his father washave done this. Not to appear       to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities,       or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful       motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_       brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian       of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the       most attentive and best of brothers. What sort of girl is Miss Darcy? He shook his head. I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me       pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her       brothervery, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and       pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and       hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a       handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand,       highly accomplished. Since her fathers death, her home has been       London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her       education. After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth       could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying: I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr.       Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,       truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they       suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley? Not at all. He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know       what Mr. Darcy is. Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does       not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he       thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals       in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the       less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich       he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and       perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure. The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered       round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between       his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual enquiries as to       his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great;       he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express       her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity       that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the       money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make       herself uneasy. I know very well, madam, said he, that when persons sit down       to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things,       and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five       shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not       say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am       removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters. Mr. Wickhams attention was caught; and after observing Mr.       Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice       whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the       family of de Bourgh. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, she replied, has very lately given       him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced       to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long. You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne       Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present       Mr. Darcy. No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherines       connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before       yesterday. Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,       and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two       estates. This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor       Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and       useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself,       if he were already self-destined for another. Mr. Collins, said she, speaks highly both of Lady Catherine       and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related       of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that       in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant,       conceited woman. I believe her to be both in a great degree, replied Wickham; I       have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I       never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and       insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and       clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities       from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,       and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that       everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the       first class. Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of       it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction       till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies       their share of Mr. Wickhams attentions. There could be no       conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillipss supper party, but       his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was       said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went       away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of       Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but       there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went,       for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked       incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the       fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of       Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least       regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper,       and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to       say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at       Longbourn House.  Chapter 17\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between       Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and       concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so       unworthy of Mr. Bingleys regard; and yet, it was not in her       nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable       appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having endured such       unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and       nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them       both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account       of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained. They have both, said she, been deceived, I dare say, in some       way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people       have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short,       impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which       may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side. Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to       say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been       concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be       obliged to think ill of somebody. Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my       opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful       light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his fathers favourite       in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide       for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had       any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most       intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no. I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingleys being imposed on,       than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as       he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without       ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides,       there was truth in his looks. It is difficult indeedit is distressing. One does not know what       to think. I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think. But Jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat Mr.       Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer       when the affair became public. The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this       conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom       they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give       their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at       Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two       ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it       an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been       doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the       family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much       as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to       the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats       with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and       hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennets civilities. The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to       every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as       given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly       flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,       instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy       evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of       their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a       great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of       everything in Mr. Darcys look and behaviour. The happiness       anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single       event, or any particular person, for though they each, like       Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he       was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a       ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her       family that she had no disinclination for it. While I can have my mornings to myself, said she, it is       enoughI think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening       engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself       one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement       as desirable for everybody. Elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion, that though       she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could       not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingleys       invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to       join in the evenings amusement; and she was rather surprised to       find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and       was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,       or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance. I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you, said he, that a       ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to       respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far       from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be       honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of       the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,       Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference       which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause,       and not to any disrespect for her. Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully       proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and       to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse       timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickhams happiness       and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr.       Collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.       She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea       it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that       _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being       mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a       quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible       visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed       his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent       attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more       astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms,       it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the       probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_.       Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well       aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any       reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did,       it was useless to quarrel about him. If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk       of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable       state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the       day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented       their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news       could be sought afterthe very shoe-roses for Netherfield were       got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her       patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of       her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance       on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and       Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.  Chapter 18 Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and       looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats       there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred       to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any       of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed       her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in       the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained       unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might       be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the       dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcys       pleasure in the Bingleys invitation to the officers; and though       this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence       was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly       applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to       town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;       adding, with a significant smile, I do not imagine his business       would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to       avoid a certain gentleman here. This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was       caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not       less answerable for Wickhams absence than if her first surmise       had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former       was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could       hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries       which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,       forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was       resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned       away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly       surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality       provoked her.\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every       prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not       dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to       Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon       able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her       cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first       two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were       dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,       apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without       being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a       disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment       of her release from him was ecstasy. She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of       talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.       When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and       was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly       addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his       application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she       accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left       to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to       console her: I dare say you will find him very agreeable. Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!       To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not       wish me such an evil. When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to       claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a       whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham       to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his       consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the       set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being       allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her       neighbours looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They       stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to       imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances,       and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying       that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige       him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He       replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she       addressed him a second time with:It is _your_ turn to say       something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_       ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the       number of couples. He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say       should be said. Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by       I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public       ones. But _now_ we may be silent. Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing? Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd       to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the       advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as       that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible. Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do       you imagine that you are gratifying mine? Both, replied Elizabeth archly; for I have always seen a great       similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,       taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say       something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to       posterity with all the _clat_ of a proverb. This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am       sure, said he. How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend       to say. _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly. I must not decide on my own performance. He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone       down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not       very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and,       unable to resist the temptation, added, When you met us there       the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance. The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread       his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though       blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length       Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, Mr. Wickham is       blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_       friendswhether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is       less certain. He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship, replied       Elizabeth with emphasis, and in a manner which he is likely to       suffer from all his life. Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the       subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to       them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the       room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of       superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his       partner. I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very       superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong       to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair       partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this       pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable       event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall       take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to       Mr. Darcy:but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank       me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young       lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me. The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but       Sir Williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him       forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious       expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.       Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,       and said, Sir Williams interruption has made me forget what we       were talking of. I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not       have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for       themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without       success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine. What think you of books? said he, smiling. Booksoh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the       same feelings. I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at       least be no want of subject. We may compare our different       opinions. NoI cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full       of something else. The _present_ always occupies you in such scenesdoes it? said       he, with a look of doubt. Yes, always, she replied, without knowing what she said, for       her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon       afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, I remember       hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,       that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very       cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created?_ I am, said he, with a firm voice. And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice? I hope not. It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their       opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first. May I ask to what these questions tend? Merely to the illustration of _your_ character, said she,       endeavouring to shake off her gravity. I am trying to make it       out. And what is your success? She shook her head. I do not get on at all. I hear such       different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly. I can readily believe, answered he gravely, that reports may       vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,       that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,       as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no       credit on either. But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another       opportunity. I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours, he coldly       replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and       parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to       an equal degree, for in Darcys breast there was a tolerably       powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and       directed all his anger against another. They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her,       and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\nSo, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George       Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking       me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite       forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was       the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcys steward. Let me       recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit       confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcys using him       ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always       been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated       Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the       particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the       least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham       mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not       well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he       was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the       way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,       indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,       Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourites guilt; but       really, considering his descent, one could not expect much       better. His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the       same, said Elizabeth angrily; for I have heard you accuse him       of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcys steward,       and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself. I beg your pardon, replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a       sneer. Excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant. Insolent girl! said Elizabeth to herself. You are much       mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as       this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the       malice of Mr. Darcy. She then sought her eldest sister, who had       undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane       met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such       happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was       satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth       instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for       Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else,       gave way before the hope of Janes being in the fairest way for       happiness. I want to know, said she, with a countenance no less smiling       than her sisters, what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But       perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any       third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon. No, replied Jane, I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing       satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of       his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which       have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the       good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is       perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less       attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to       say by his account as well as his sisters, Mr. Wickham is by no       means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very       imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcys regard. Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself? No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton. This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am       satisfied. But what does he say of the living? He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has       heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it       was left to him _conditionally_ only. I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingleys sincerity, said Elizabeth       warmly; but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances       only. Mr. Bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one, I       dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the       story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall       venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before. She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,       and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth       listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which       Jane entertained of Mr. Bingleys regard, and said all in her       power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by       Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose       enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had       scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told       her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as       to make a most important discovery. I have found out, said he, by a singular accident, that there       is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to       overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who       does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de       Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these       sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with,       perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I       am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay       my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will       excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the       connection must plead my apology. You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy! Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it       earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherines _nephew_. It will       be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well       yesterday sennight. Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring       him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without       introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment       to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should       be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong       to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the       acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air       of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,       replied thus: My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world       in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of       your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a       wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst       the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me       leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in       point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided       that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time       maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of       my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I       look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by       your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant       guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted       by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a       young lady like yourself. And with a low bow he left her to       attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly       watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very       evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and       though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it       all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology,       Hunsford, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. It vexed her to see       him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with       unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him       time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.       Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and       Mr. Darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length       of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a       slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to       Elizabeth. I have no reason, I assure you, said he, to be dissatisfied       with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the       attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid       me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady       Catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a       favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon       the whole, I am much pleased with him.\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she       turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.       Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her       observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as       Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the       felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she       felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to       like Bingleys two sisters. Her mothers thoughts she plainly saw       were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near       her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,       therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which       placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to       find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)       freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane       would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating       subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while       enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a       charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from       them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was       such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,       and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as       she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her       younger daughters, as Janes marrying so greatly must throw them       in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at       her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to       the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go       into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this       circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it       is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to       find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She       concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be       equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing       there was no chance of it. In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her       mothers words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a       less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she       could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy,       who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being       nonsensical. What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I       am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged       to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear. For heavens sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be       for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to       his friend by so doing! Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her       mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.       Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She       could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though       every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was       not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his       attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face       changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and       steady gravity. At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady       Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights       which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts       of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not       long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,       singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing       Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the       company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she       endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;       Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting       was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeths eyes       were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched       her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which       was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,       amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she       might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of       half a minute began another. Marys powers were by no means       fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner       affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see       how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.       She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of       derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,       imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his       interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the       hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,       That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long       enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit. Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;       and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her fathers speech,       was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were       now applied to. If I, said Mr. Collins, were so fortunate as to be able to       sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the       company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent       diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a       clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be       justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there       are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a       parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an       agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not       offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the       time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and       the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be       excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not       think it of light importance that he should have attentive and       conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those       to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;       nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of       testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the       family. And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,       which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.       Many staredmany smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.       Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins       for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to       Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young       man. To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement       to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it       would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more       spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley       and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his       notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much       distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his       two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an       opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she       could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman,       or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable. The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was       teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her       side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him       again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did       she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to       introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that       as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief       object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and       that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her       the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She       owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often       joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collinss       conversation to herself. She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcys further       notice; though often standing within a very short distance of       her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She       felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.       Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,       and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their       carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,       which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by       some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened       their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently       impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every       attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a       languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by       the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr.       Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment,       and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their       behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet,       in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane       were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and       talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a       silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was       too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation       of Lord, how tired I am! accompanied by a violent yawn. When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most       pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at       Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to       assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner       with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal       invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily       engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,       after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the       next day for a short time. Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under       the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary       preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,       she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in       the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter       married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and       with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the       least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the       match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was       eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.  Chapter 19 The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made       his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of       time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following       Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it       distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a       very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed       a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet,       Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after       breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter       Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience       with her in the course of this morning? Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,       Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, Oh dear!yescertainly. I am       sure Lizzy will be very happyI am sure she can have no       objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs. And, gathering her       work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out: Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must       excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not       hear. I am going away myself. No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.       And upon Elizabeths seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed       looks, about to escape, she added: Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your       staying and hearing Mr. Collins. Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments       consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to       get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down       again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings       which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet       and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins       began. Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far       from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other       perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had       there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to       assure you, that I have your respected mothers permission for       this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,       however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my       attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as       I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my       future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this       subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons       for marryingand, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with       the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did. The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run       away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that       she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to       stop him further, and he continued: My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right       thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to       set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am       convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and       thirdlywhich perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it       is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble       lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she       condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this       subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left       Hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was       arranging Miss de Bourghs footstool, that she said, Mr.       Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose       properly, choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_,       let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high,       but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice.       Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and       I will visit her. Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair       cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady       Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my       power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable       to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect       which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general       intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my       views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own       neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable       young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit       this estate after the death of your honoured father (who,       however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself       without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that       the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the       melancholy event takes placewhich, however, as I have already       said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my       fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your       esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To       fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of       that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could       not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four       per cents, which will not be yours till after your mothers       decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,       therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when       we are married. It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. You are too hasty, sir, she cried. You forget that I have made       no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my       thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible       of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to       do otherwise than to decline them. I am not now to learn, replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave       of the hand, that it is usual with young ladies to reject the       addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he       first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is       repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no       means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to       lead you to the altar ere long. Upon my word, sir, cried Elizabeth, your hope is a rather       extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am       not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)       who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of       being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.       You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the       last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your       friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find       me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\nWere it certain that Lady Catherine would think so, said Mr.       Collins very gravelybut I cannot imagine that her ladyship       would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I       have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very       highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable       qualification. Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You       must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment       of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and       by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being       otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the       delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take       possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any       self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as       finally settled. And rising as she thus spoke, she would have       quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her: When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the       subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than       you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of       cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established       custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and       perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as       would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female       character. Really, Mr. Collins, cried Elizabeth with some warmth, you       puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to       you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my       refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one. You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that       your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My       reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to       me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the       establishment I can offer would be any other than highly       desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family       of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances       highly in my favour; and you should take it into further       consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is       by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be       made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all       likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable       qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not       serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it       to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the       usual practice of elegant females. I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to       that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable       man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed       sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done       me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely       impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak       plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending       to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth       from her heart. You are uniformly charming! cried he, with an air of awkward       gallantry; and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the       express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals       will not fail of being acceptable. To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would       make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew;       determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals       as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose       negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and       whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the       affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.  Chapter 20 Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his       successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the       vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw       Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the       staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated       both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their       nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these       felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate       the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he       trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal       which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow       from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her       character. This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have       been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to       encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared       not believe it, and could not help saying so. But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins, she added, that Lizzy shall       be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She       is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own       interest but I will _make_ her know it. Pardon me for interrupting you, madam, cried Mr. Collins; but       if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she       would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my       situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage       state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,       perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,       because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not       contribute much to my felicity. Sir, you quite misunderstand me, said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.       Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything       else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go       directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with       her, I am sure. She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to       her husband, called out as she entered the library, Oh! Mr.       Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You       must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will       not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his       mind and not have _her_. Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and       fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the       least altered by her communication. I have not the pleasure of understanding you, said he, when she       had finished her speech. Of what are you talking? Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.       Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have       Lizzy. And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless       business. Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon       her marrying him. Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion. Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the       library. Come here, child, cried her father as she appeared. I have       sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr.       Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true? Elizabeth       replied that it was. Very welland this offer of marriage you       have refused? I have, sir. Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon       your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet? Yes, or I will never see her again. An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day       you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will       never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will       never see you again if you _do_. Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a       beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her       husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively       disappointed. What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised       me to _insist_ upon her marrying him. My dear, replied her husband, I have two small favours to       request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my       understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.       I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be. Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,       did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again       and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to       secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible       mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with       real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to       her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination       never did. Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had       passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what       motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was       hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite       imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mothers       reproach prevented his feeling any regret. While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to       spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,       who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, I am glad you are       come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened       this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she       will not have him.\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by       Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they       entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she       likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her       compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to       comply with the wishes of all her family. Pray do, my dear Miss       Lucas, she added in a melancholy tone, for nobody is on my       side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels       for my poor nerves. Charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and       Elizabeth. Aye, there she comes, continued Mrs. Bennet, looking as       unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were       at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss       Lizzyif you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer       of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at alland       I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father       is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep youand so I warn you. I       have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library,       you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will       find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to       undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in       talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous       complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can       tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not       complain are never pitied. Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that       any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase       the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption       from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who       entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on       perceiving whom, she said to the girls, Now, I do insist upon       it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr.       Collins have a little conversation together. Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty       followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she       could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.       Collins, whose enquiries after herself and all her family were       very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself       with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a       doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: Oh!       Mr. Collins! My dear madam, replied he, let us be for ever silent on this       point. Far be it from me, he presently continued, in a voice       that marked his displeasure, to resent the behaviour of your       daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all;       the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I       have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps       not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had       my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often       observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the       blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our       estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any       disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my       pretensions to your daughters favour, without having paid       yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to       interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be       objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your       daughters lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to       error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My       object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with       due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my       _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to       apologise.  Chapter 21 The discussion of Mr. Collinss offer was now nearly at an end,       and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings       necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish       allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_       feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or       dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner       and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the       assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself       were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose       civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all,       and especially to her friend. The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennets ill-humour or       ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry       pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his       visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.       He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant       to stay. After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Mr.       Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the       Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and       attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation, and       the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth,       however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his       absence _had_ been self-imposed. I found, said he, as the time drew near that I had better not       meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with       him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear,       and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself. She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a       full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they       civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer       walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he       particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double       advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and       it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her       father and mother. Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet;       it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of       elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a ladys       fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sisters countenance       change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some       particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting       the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the       general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the       subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no       sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from       Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained       their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said: This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me       a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time,       and are on their way to townand without any intention of coming       back again. You shall hear what she says. She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the       information of their having just resolved to follow their brother       to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor       Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:       I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in       Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we       will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that       delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may       lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most       unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that. To these       highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the       insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their       removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it       was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would       prevent Mr. Bingleys being there; and as to the loss of their       society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in       the enjoyment of his. It is unlucky, said she, after a short pause, that you should       not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.       But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which       Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware,       and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends       will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr.       Bingley will not be detained in London by them. Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into       Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\nWhen my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business       which took him to London might be concluded in three or four       days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time       convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry       to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither,       that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a       comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for       the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend,       had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of that I       despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may       abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and       that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling       the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you. It is evident by this, added Jane, that he comes back no more       this winter. It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he       _should_. Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own       master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage       which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the       truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really       do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,       and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and       myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from       the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I       do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on       this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding       them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My       brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent       opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her       relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a       sisters partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call       Charles most capable of engaging any womans heart. With all       these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to       prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of       an event which will secure the happiness of so many? What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy? said Jane       as she finished it. Is it not clear enough? Does it not       expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to       be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers       indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings       for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can       there be any other opinion on the subject? Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear       it? Most willingly. You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her       brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.       She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries       to persuade you that he does not care about you. Jane shook her head. Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen       you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure,       cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as       much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her       wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or       grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss       Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been       _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a       second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare       say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,       my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss       Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is       in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he       took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to       persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very       much in love with her friend. If we thought alike of Miss Bingley, replied Jane, your       representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know       the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully       deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that       she is deceiving herself. That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea,       since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be       deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and       must fret no longer. But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in       accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to       marry elsewhere? You must decide for yourself, said Elizabeth; and if, upon       mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his       two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his       wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him. How can you talk so? said Jane, faintly smiling. You must know       that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their       disapprobation, I could not hesitate. I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot       consider your situation with much compassion. But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be       required. A thousand things may arise in six months! The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the       utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of       Carolines interested wishes, and she could not for a moment       suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,       could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone. She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she       felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its       happy effect. Janes temper was not desponding, and she was       gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection       sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to       Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart. They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of       the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans       conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great       deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that       the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting       so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some       length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon       down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of       all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been       invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two       full courses.  Chapter 22 The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again       during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen       to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.       It keeps him in good humour, said she, and I am more obliged       to you than I can express. Charlotte assured her friend of her       satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for       the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but       Charlottes kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any       conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her       from any return of Mr. Collinss addresses, by engaging them       towards herself. Such was Miss Lucass scheme; and appearances       were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would       have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave       Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the       fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape       out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness,       and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was       anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction       that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture       his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till       its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost       secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably       encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure       of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering       kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked       towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally       in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love       and eloquence awaited her there. In as short a time as Mr. Collinss long speeches would allow,       everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;       and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name       the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such       a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no       inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with       which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any       charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss       Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested       desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment       were gained.\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their       consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr.       Collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for       their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his       prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas       began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter       had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was       likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion,       that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the       Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and       his wife should make their appearance at St. Jamess. The whole       family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The       younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner       than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved       from their apprehension of Charlottes dying an old maid.       Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her       point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in       general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither       sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his       attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her       husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,       marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision       for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however       uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest       preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained;       and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been       handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable       circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to       Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any       other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame       her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings       must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her       the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when       he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had       passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of       course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without       difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst       forth in such very direct questions on his return as required       some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising       great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous       love. As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any       of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when       the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great       politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see       him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him       to visit them. My dear madam, he replied, this invitation is particularly       gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and       you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon       as possible. They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means       wish for so speedy a return, immediately said: But is there not danger of Lady Catherines disapprobation here,       my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the       risk of offending your patroness. My dear sir, replied Mr. Collins, I am particularly obliged to       you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not       taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence. You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather       than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by       your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly       probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall       take no offence. Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such       affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily       receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other       mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my       fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render       it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health       and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth. With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them       equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet       wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his       addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been       prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher       than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections       which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as       herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve       himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very       agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of       this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast,       and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of       the day before. The possibility of Mr. Collinss fancying himself in love with       her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or       two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far       from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her       astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first       the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out: Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotteimpossible! The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling       her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so       direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected,       she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied: Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it       incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any womans       good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with       you? But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong       effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that       the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her,       and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. I see what you are feeling, replied Charlotte. You must be       surprised, very much surprisedso lately as Mr. Collins was       wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it       over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am       not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable       home; and considering Mr. Collinss character, connection, and       situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness       with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the       marriage state. Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly; and after an awkward       pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not       stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what       she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all       reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness       of Mr. Collinss making two offers of marriage within three days       was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had       always felt that Charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly       like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,       when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better       feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins       was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend       disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the       distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to       be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.  Chapter 23 Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on       what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to       mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his       daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many       compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of       a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matterto an       audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet,       with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be       entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil,       boisterously exclaimed: Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not       you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy? Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne       without anger such treatment; but Sir Williams good breeding       carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be       positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all       their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so       unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his       account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte       herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her       mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to       Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by       making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be       expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,       and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal       while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than       her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she       persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she       was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she       trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,       that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were       plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real       cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been       barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she       principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could       console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out       her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth       without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak       to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months       were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. Mr. Bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,       and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most       agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that       Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably       sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his       daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she       said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for       their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it       as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,       for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no       other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton. Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to       retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well       married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to       say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennets sour looks and       ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness       away. Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept       them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded       that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.       Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard       to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her       opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew       daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and       nothing more was heard of his return. Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was       counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.       The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on       Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the       solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family       might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that       head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous       expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of       their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it       was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been       so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at       Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday       fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his       marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,       which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his       amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the       happiest of men. Mr. Collinss return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of       pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much       disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange       that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it       was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated       having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent,       and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were       the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the       greater distress of Mr. Bingleys continued absence. Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day       after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him       than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming       no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly       incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as       a most scandalous falsehood. Even Elizabeth began to fearnot that Bingley was indifferentbut       that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.       Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Janes       happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she       could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of       his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend,       assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of       London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his       attachment. As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course,       more painful than Elizabeths, but whatever she felt she was       desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,       therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such       delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which       she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his       arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come       back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Janes       steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable       tranquillity. Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his       reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been       on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need       much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of       love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The       chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he       sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology       for his absence before the family went to bed. Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention       of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of       ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it       talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her       successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous       abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded       her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she       spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were       talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself       and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were       dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. Indeed, Mr. Bennet, said she, it is very hard to think that       Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_       should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take       her place in it! My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope       for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the       survivor. This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,       instead of making any answer, she went on as before. I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If       it was not for the entail, I should not mind it. What should not you mind? I should not mind anything at all. Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such       insensibility. I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the       entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an       estate from ones own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for       the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he_ have it more than       anybody else? I leave it to yourself to determine, said Mr. Bennet.  Chapter 24 Miss Bingleys letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very       first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled       in London for the winter, and concluded with her brothers regret       at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in       Hertfordshire before he left the country. Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the       rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed       affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss       Darcys praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions       were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their       increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment       of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She       wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate       of Mr. Darcys house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of       the latter with regard to new furniture.\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all       this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided       between concern for her sister, and resentment against all       others. To Carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to       Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane,       she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had       always been disposed to like him, she could not think without       anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that       want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his       designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness       to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness,       however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to       sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her       sisters was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible       himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be       long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing       else; and yet whether Bingleys regard had really died away, or       were suppressed by his friends interference; whether he had been       aware of Janes attachment, or whether it had escaped his       observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him       must be materially affected by the difference, her sisters       situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded. A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her       feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennets leaving them       together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield       and its master, she could not help saying: Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can       have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual       reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long.       He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before. Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but       said nothing. You doubt me, cried Jane, slightly colouring; indeed, you have       no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my       acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or       fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not       _that_ pain. A little time, thereforeI shall certainly try to       get the better. With a stronger voice she soon added, I have this comfort       immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on       my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself. My dear Jane! exclaimed Elizabeth, you are too good. Your       sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know       what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or       loved you as you deserve. Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw       back the praise on her sisters warm affection. Nay, said Elizabeth, this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all       the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.       _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself       against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my       encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need       not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of       whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I       dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the       inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little       dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or       sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not       mention; the other is Charlottes marriage. It is unaccountable!       In every view it is unaccountable! My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They       will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for       difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collinss       respectability, and Charlottes steady, prudent character.       Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune,       it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for       everybodys sake, that she may feel something like regard and       esteem for our cousin. To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no       one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I       persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only       think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My       dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,       silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as       well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper       way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte       Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the       meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade       yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility       of danger security for happiness. I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,       replied Jane; and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing       them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something       else. You mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you,       but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that       person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must       not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must       not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and       circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that       deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does. And men take care that they should. If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have       no idea of there being so much design in the world as some       persons imagine. I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingleys conduct to       design, said Elizabeth; but without scheming to do wrong, or to       make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.       Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other peoples feelings,       and want of resolution, will do the business. And do you impute it to either of those? Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by       saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you       can. You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him? Yes, in conjunction with his friend. I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They       can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no       other woman can secure it. Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides       his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and       consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the       importance of money, great connections, and pride. Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy, replied       Jane; but this may be from better feelings than you are       supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known       me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their       own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their       brothers. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it,       unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed       him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so,       they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make       everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do       not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been       mistakenor, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison       of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let       me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be       understood. Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.       Bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them. Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning       no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did       not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever       considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to       convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his       attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and       transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but       though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,       she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennets best       comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer. Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. So, Lizzy, said he       one day, your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate       her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little       in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives       her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn       to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is       your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all       the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a       pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably. Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We       must not all expect Janes good fortune. True, said Mr. Bennet, but it is a comfort to think that       whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate       mother who will make the most of it.\nMr. Wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the       gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of       the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other       recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The       whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr.       Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly       acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to       know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had       known anything of the matter. Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might       be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the       society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always       pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakesbut       by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.  Chapter 25 After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of       felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by       the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might       be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of       his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his       return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to       make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at       Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair       cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father       another letter of thanks. On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of       receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend       the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,       gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by       nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had       difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within       view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and       agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.       Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant       woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.       Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a       particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in       town. The first part of Mrs. Gardiners business on her arrival was to       distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When       this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her       turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and       much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she       last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of       marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. I do not blame Jane, she continued, for Jane would have got       Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard       to think that she might have been Mr. Collinss wife by this       time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an       offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of       it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I       have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as       ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are       all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so       it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in       my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves       before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is       the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you       tell us, of long sleeves. Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given       before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeths correspondence with       her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her       nieces, turned the conversation. When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the       subject. It seems likely to have been a desirable match for       Jane, said she. I am sorry it went off. But these things happen       so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so       easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when       accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort       of inconsistencies are very frequent. An excellent consolation in its way, said Elizabeth, but it       will not do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not       often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a       young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom       he was violently in love with only a few days before. But that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed, so       doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is       as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hours       acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent       was_ Mr. Bingleys love? I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite       inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every       time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own       ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to       dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an       answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility       the very essence of love? Oh, yes!of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.       Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she       may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to       _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.       But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?       Change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief       from home may be as useful as anything. Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt       persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence. I hope, added Mrs. Gardiner, that no consideration with regard       to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a       part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you       well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that       they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her. And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of       his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on       Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think       of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as       Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a months ablution       enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter       it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him. So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does       not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to       help calling. She will drop the acquaintance entirely. But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to       place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of       Bingleys being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude       on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did       not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes       she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated,       and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the       more natural influence of Janes attractions. Miss Bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure; and the       Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than       as she hoped by Carolines not living in the same house with her       brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without       any danger of seeing him. The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the       Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day       without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for       the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not       once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for       home, some of the officers always made part of itof which       officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,       Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeths warm       commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing       them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their       preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little       uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject       before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the       imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,       unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years       ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in       that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had,       therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had       been little there since the death of Darcys father, it was yet       in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former       friends than she had been in the way of procuring.\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by       character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible       subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley       with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in       bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late       possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made       acquainted with the present Mr. Darcys treatment of him, she       tried to remember some of that gentlemans reputed disposition       when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at       last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy       formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.  Chapter 26 Mrs. Gardiners caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly       given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her       alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went       on: You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely       because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not       afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your       guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an       affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.       I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting       young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should       think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let       your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect       you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and       good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father. My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed. Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise. Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of       myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me,       if I can prevent it. Elizabeth, you are not serious now. I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love       with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all       comparison, the most agreeable man I ever sawand if he becomes       really attached to meI believe it will be better that he should       not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!       My fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I       should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial       to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to       be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every       day that where there is affection, young people are seldom       withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into       engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than       so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even       to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise       you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry       to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with       him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best. Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so       very often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of       inviting him. As I did the other day, said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:       very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do       not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your       account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You       know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company       for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do       what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied. Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked       her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful       instance of advice being given on such a point, without being       resented. Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been       quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode       with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.       Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at       length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even       repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she _wished_       they might be happy. Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on       Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose       to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mothers ungracious and       reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,       accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs       together, Charlotte said: I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza. _That_ you certainly shall. And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me? We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire. I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me,       therefore, to come to Hunsford. Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in       the visit. My father and Maria are coming to me in March, added Charlotte,       and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza,       you will be as welcome as either of them. The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent       from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to       hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her       friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as       it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was       impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling       that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined       not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what       had been, rather than what was. Charlottes first letters were       received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be       curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she       would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce       herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt       that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she       might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with       comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The       house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her       taste, and Lady Catherines behaviour was most friendly and       obliging. It was Mr. Collinss picture of Hunsford and Rosings       rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait       for her own visit there to know the rest. Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce       their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth       hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys. Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as       impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without       either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it,       however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from       Longbourn had by some accident been lost. My aunt, she continued, is going to-morrow into that part of       the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in       Grosvenor Street. She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss       Bingley. I did not think Caroline in spirits, were her words,       but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving       her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my       last letter had never reached her. I enquired after their       brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.       Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy       was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not       long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I       shall see them soon here. Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that       accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sisters being in       town. Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She       endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but       she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingleys inattention. After       waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing       every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last       appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the       alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no       longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister       will prove what she felt.\nMy dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in       her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to       have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingleys regard for me. But,       my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not       think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her       behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I       do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate       with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am       sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit       till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the       meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no       pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not       calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and       was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went       away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no       longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very       wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every       advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am       very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need       not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to       be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account       for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his       sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural       and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such       fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have       met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from       something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner       of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is       really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were       not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say       that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I       will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of       what will make me happyyour affection, and the invariable       kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very       soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to       Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any       certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that       you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.       Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you       will be very comfortable there.Yours, etc. This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as       she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister       at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely       over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.       His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for       him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped       he might really soon marry Mr. Darcys sister, as by Wickhams       account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown       away. Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise       concerning that gentleman, and required information; and       Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to       her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided,       his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.       Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it       and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but       slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing       that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted       it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most       remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering       himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in       this case than in Charlottes, did not quarrel with him for his       wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more       natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few       struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and       desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him       happy. All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating       the circumstances, she thus went on: I am now convinced, my dear       aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really       experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present       detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my       feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even       impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at       all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good       sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness       has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more       interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in       love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative       insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.       Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.       They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the       mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something       to live on as well as the plain.  Chapter 27 With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and       otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,       sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass       away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at       first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she       soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned       to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater       certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte       again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty       in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such       uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little       change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would       moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew       near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,       however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to       Charlottes first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and       his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in       London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan       could be. The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss       her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her       going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to       answer her letter. The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly       friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not       make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and       to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the       first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu,       wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to       expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of       hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide, there was a       solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to       him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced       that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of       the amiable and pleasing. Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her       think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter       Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had       nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to       with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth       loved absurdities, but she had known Sir Williams too long. He       could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and       knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his       information. It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so       early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to       Mr. Gardiners door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching       their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to       welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was       pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs       were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their       cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the       drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a       twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and       kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in       bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres. Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object       was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear,       in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always       struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of       dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would       not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of       Miss Bingleys visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated       conversations occurring at different times between Jane and       herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given       up the acquaintance.\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickhams desertion, and       complimented her on bearing it so well. But my dear Elizabeth, she added, what sort of girl is Miss       King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary. Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial       affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does       discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid       of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now,       because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds,       you want to find out that he is mercenary. If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall       know what to think. She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of       her. But he paid her not the smallest attention till her       grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune. Nowhy should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_       affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be       for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was       equally poor? But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions       towards her so soon after this event. A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those       elegant decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does       not object to it, why should _we_? _Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her       being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling. Well, cried Elizabeth, have it as you choose. _He_ shall be       mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish. No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry,       you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in       Derbyshire. Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who       live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in       Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank       Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not       one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to       recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after       all. Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of       disappointment. Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had       the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle       and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the       summer. We have not determined how far it shall carry us, said Mrs.       Gardiner, but, perhaps, to the Lakes. No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her       acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. Oh, my       dear, dear aunt, she rapturously cried, what delight! what       felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to       disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and       mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when       we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without       being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know       where we have gonewe _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes,       mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our       imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular       scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let       _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the       generality of travellers.  Chapter 28 Every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to       Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she       had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her       health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant       source of delight. When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye       was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to       bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary       on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she       had heard of its inhabitants. At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to       the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the       laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins       and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at       the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house,       amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they       were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.       Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and       Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found       herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her       cousins manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal       civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some       minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all       her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing       out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as       soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time,       with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually       repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment. Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not       help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the       room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself       particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had       lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and       comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of       repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she       could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.       Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be       ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily       turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a       faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After       sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the       room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of       their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.       Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was       large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he       attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most       respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of       countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of       the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.       Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and       scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked       for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left       beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every       direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most       distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which       the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with       the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that       bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was       a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground. From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two       meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the       remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William       accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the       house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity       of showing it without her husbands help. It was rather small,       but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and       arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave       Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten,       there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by       Charlottes evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must       be often forgotten. She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the       country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when       Mr. Collins joining in, observed: Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady       Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need       not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and       condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some       portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any       hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in       every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.       Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at       Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her       ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us. I _should_ say,       one of her ladyships carriages, for she has several. Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,       added Charlotte, and a most attentive neighbour. Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort       of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,       and telling again what had already been written; and when it       closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to       meditate upon Charlottes degree of contentment, to understand       her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her       husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She       had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor       of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.       Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A       lively imagination soon settled it all. About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting       ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole       house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard       somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly       after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing       place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the       dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not       tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment. Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing       more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the       lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a       low phaeton at the garden gate. And is this all? cried Elizabeth. I expected at least that the       pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady       Catherine and her daughter. La! my dear, said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, it is       not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives       with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is       quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be       so thin and small? She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all       this wind. Why does she not come in? Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of       favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in. I like her appearance, said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.       She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well.       She will make him a very proper wife. Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in       conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeths       high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest       contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing       whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way. At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,       and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw       the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good       fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the       whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.  Chapter 29 Mr. Collinss triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was       complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness       to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility       towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for;       and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was       such an instance of Lady Catherines condescension, as he knew       not how to admire enough. I confess, said he, that I should not have been at all       surprised by her ladyships asking us on Sunday to drink tea and       spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my       knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could       have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined       that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an       invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately       after your arrival! I am the less surprised at what has happened, replied Sir       William, from that knowledge of what the manners of the great       really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.       About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not       uncommon. Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but       their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing       them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,       so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly       overpower them. When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to       Elizabeth Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.       Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us       which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely       to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere       is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think       the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the       distinction of rank preserved. While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their       different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady       Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.       Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of       living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to       company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings       with as much apprehension as her father had done to his       presentation at St. Jamess. As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a       mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its       prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she       could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene       to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of       the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the       glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh. When they ascended the steps to the hall, Marias alarm was every       moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly       calm. Elizabeths courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing       of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary       talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money       or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation. From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a       rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,       they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room       where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were       sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive       them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that       the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a       proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he       would have thought necessary. In spite of having been at St. Jamess, Sir William was so       completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but       just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat       without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of       her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way       to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and       could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady       Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,       which might once have been handsome. Her air was not       conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to       make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not       rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken       in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and       brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeths mind; and from the       observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to       be exactly what he represented. When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and       deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she       turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in       Marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was       neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss       de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain,       were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low       voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing       remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she       said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her       eyes. After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the       windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point       out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that       it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the       servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had       promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at       the bottom of the table, by her ladyships desire, and looked as       if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,       and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was       commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now       enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a       manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But       Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,       and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the       table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much       conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an       opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de       Bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady       Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.       Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss       de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing       she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,       and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire. When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to       be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without       any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on       every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not       used to have her judgement controverted. She enquired into       Charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a       great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her       how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as       hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her       poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great       ladys attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of       dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.       Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and       Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she       knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very       genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times,       how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than       herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether       they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage       her father kept, and what had been her mothers maiden name?       Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered       them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed, Your fathers estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For       your sake, turning to Charlotte, I am glad of it; but otherwise       I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It       was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourghs family. Do you       play and sing, Miss Bennet? A little. Oh! thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our       instrument is a capital one, probably superior toYou shall try       it some day. Do your sisters play and sing? One of them does. Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The       Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income       as yours. Do you draw? No, not at all. What, none of you? Not one. That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your       mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit       of masters. My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates       London. Has your governess left you? We never had any governess. No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up       at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your       mother must have been quite a slave to your education. Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had       not been the case. Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess,       you must have been neglected. Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us       as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always       encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.       Those who chose to be idle, certainly might. Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if       I had known your mother, I should have advised her most       strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be       done in education without steady and regular instruction, and       nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many       families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am       always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of       Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means;       and it was but the other day that I recommended another young       person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the       family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you       of Lady Metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss       Pope a treasure. Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a       treasure. Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet? Yes, maam, all. All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the       second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!       Your younger sisters must be very young? Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to       be much in company. But really, maam, I think it would be very       hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share       of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the       means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a       right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back       on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to       promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind. Upon my word, said her ladyship, you give your opinion very       decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age? With three younger sisters grown up, replied Elizabeth,       smiling, your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it. Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct       answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature       who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need       not conceal your age. I am not one-and-twenty. When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the       card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and       Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose       to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting       Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was       superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did       not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her       fears of Miss de Bourghs being too hot or too cold, or having       too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the       other table. Lady Catherine was generally speakingstating the       mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of       herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her       ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and       apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not       say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble       names. When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they       chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to       Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The       party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine       determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From       these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the       coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collinss       side and as many bows on Sir Williams they departed. As soon as       they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her       cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings,       which, for Charlottes sake, she made more favourable than it       really was. But her commendation, though costing her some       trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very       soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands.  Chapter 30 Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was       long enough to convince him of his daughters being most       comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and       such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William       was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out       in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away,       the whole family returned to their usual employments, and       Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her       cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between       breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the       garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window       in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which       the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather       wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for       common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant       aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason       for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been       much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally       lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,       and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what       carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh       drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform       them of, though it happened almost every day. She not       unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes       conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon       to get out. Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to       Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it       necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that       there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could       not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they       were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped       her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.       She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and       advised them to do it differently; found fault with the       arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in       negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it       only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collinss joints of       meat were too large for her family. Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in       the commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active       magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were       carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers       were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she       sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,       silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty. The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a       week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being       only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was       the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few,       as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond       Mr. Collinss reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and       upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were       half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the       weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great       enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she       frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine,       was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where       there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but       herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherines       curiosity. In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed       away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to       bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a       circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her       arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few       weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom       she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively       new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused       in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingleys designs on him were, by his       behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by       Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest       satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration,       and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been       frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself. His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was       walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into       Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and       after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park,       hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following       morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were       two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had       brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his       uncle Lord , and, to the great surprise of all the party, when       Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte       had seen them from her husbands room, crossing the road, and       immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour       they might expect, adding: I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy       would never have come so soon to wait upon me. Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the       compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell,       and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.       Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not       handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr.       Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in       Hertfordshirepaid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to       Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her       friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth       merely curtseyed to him without saying a word. Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the       readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very       pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight       observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some       time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his       civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the       health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and       after a moments pause, added: My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you       never happened to see her there? She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to       see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed       between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little       confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to       meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the       gentlemen soon afterwards went away.  Chapter 31 Colonel Fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the       Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably       to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some       days, however, before they received any invitation thitherfor       while there were visitors in the house, they could not be       necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after       the gentlemens arrival, that they were honoured by such an       attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to       come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very       little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had       called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.       Darcy they had seen only at church. The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they       joined the party in Lady Catherines drawing-room. Her ladyship       received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by       no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she       was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them,       especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the       room. Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was       a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collinss pretty       friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated       himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and       Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books       and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained       in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and       flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well       as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned       towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,       after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged,       for she did not scruple to call out: What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are       talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it       is. We are speaking of music, madam, said he, when no longer able       to avoid a reply. Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my       delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are       speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose,       who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better       natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great       proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to       apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.       How does Georgiana get on, Darcy? Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters       proficiency. I am very glad to hear such a good account of her, said Lady       Catherine; and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to       excel if she does not practice a good deal. I assure you, madam, he replied, that she does not need such       advice. She practises very constantly.\nSo much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next       write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any       account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is       to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet       several times, that she will never play really well unless she       practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is       very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every       day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinsons room. She       would be in nobodys way, you know, in that part of the house. Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill-breeding, and       made no answer. When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of       having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the       instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to       half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew;       till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual       deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to       command a full view of the fair performers countenance.       Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient       pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said: You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state       to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play       so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to       be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at       every attempt to intimidate me. I shall not say you are mistaken, he replied, because you       could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming       you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough       to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing       opinions which in fact are not your own. Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said       to Colonel Fitzwilliam, Your cousin will give you a very pretty       notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am       particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose       my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to       pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it       is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my       disadvantage in Hertfordshireand, give me leave to say, very       impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate, and such       things may come out as will shock your relations to hear. I am not afraid of you, said he, smilingly. Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of, cried Colonel       Fitzwilliam. I should like to know how he behaves among       strangers. You shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very       dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,       you must know, was at a balland at this ball, what do you think       he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;       and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was       sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the       fact. I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the       assembly beyond my own party. True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,       Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your       orders. Perhaps, said Darcy, I should have judged better, had I sought       an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to       strangers. Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this? said Elizabeth,       still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. Shall we ask him why a man       of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill       qualified to recommend himself to strangers? I can answer your question, said Fitzwilliam, without applying       to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble. I certainly have not the talent which some people possess, said       Darcy, of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.       I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested       in their concerns, as I often see done. My fingers, said Elizabeth, do not move over this instrument       in the masterly manner which I see so many womens do. They have       not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same       expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own       faultbecause I will not take the trouble of practising. It is       not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other       womans of superior execution. Darcy smiled and said, You are perfectly right. You have       employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege       of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us       perform to strangers. Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to       know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began       playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening       for a few minutes, said to Darcy: Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,       and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very       good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to       Annes. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her       health allowed her to learn. Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his       cousins praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other       could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his       behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss       Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_,       had she been his relation. Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeths performance,       mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.       Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility,       and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument       till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home.  Chapter 32 Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to       Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the       village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain       signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it       not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension       was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape       all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very       great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room. He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for       his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the       ladies were to be within. They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were       made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was       absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in       this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in       Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on       the subject of their hasty departure, she observed: How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.       Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley       to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he       went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope,       when you left London? Perfectly so, I thank you. She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a       short pause added: I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of       ever returning to Netherfield again? I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may       spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many       friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements       are continually increasing. If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better       for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely,       for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But,       perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the       convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must       expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle. I should not be surprised, said Darcy, if he were to give it       up as soon as any eligible purchase offers. Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his       friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to       leave the trouble of finding a subject to him. He took the hint, and soon began with, This seems a very       comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to       it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford. I believe she didand I am sure she could not have bestowed her       kindness on a more grateful object. Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a       wife. Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with       one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him,       or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent       understandingthough I am not certain that I consider her       marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems       perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is       certainly a very good match for her. It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a       distance of her own family and friends. An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles. And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a       days journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance. I should never have considered the distance as one of the       _advantages_ of the match, cried Elizabeth. I should never have       said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family.\nIt is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything       beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would       appear far. As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she       understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and       Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near       her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on       many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the       expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But       that is not the case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a       comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent       journeysand I am persuaded my friend would not call herself       _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance. Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, _You_       cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_       cannot have been always at Longbourn. Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change       of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the       table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice: Are you pleased with Kent? A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either       side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of       Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The       _tte--tte_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which       had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a       few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away. What can be the meaning of this? said Charlotte, as soon as he       was gone. My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he       would never have called on us in this familiar way. But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very       likely, even to Charlottes wishes, to be the case; and after       various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to       proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was       the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were       over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a       billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and       in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk       to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a       temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.       They called at various times of the morning, sometimes       separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by       their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam       came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which       of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded       by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his       evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George       Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less       captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliams manners, she       believed he might have the best informed mind. But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more       difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he       frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his       lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity       rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to       himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew       not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliams occasionally       laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally       different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told       her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the       effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she       set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him       whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford;       but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a       great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It       was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether       there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing       but absence of mind. She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of       his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the       idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the       subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only       end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a       doubt, that all her friends dislike would vanish, if she could       suppose him to be in her power. In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her       marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most       pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life       was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.       Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin       could have none at all.  Chapter 33 More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,       unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the       mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought,       and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him       at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could       occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and       even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary       penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal       enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually       thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never       said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of       talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of       their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected       questionsabout her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of       solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collinss       happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly       understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she       came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words       seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his       thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an       allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a       little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the       pales opposite the Parsonage. She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Janes last       letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had       not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by       Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was       meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a       smile, she said: I did not know before that you ever walked this way. I have been making the tour of the park, he replied, as I       generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at       the Parsonage. Are you going much farther? No, I should have turned in a moment. And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the       Parsonage together. Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday? said she. Yesif Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his       disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases. And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at       least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know       anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes       than Mr. Darcy. He likes to have his own way very well, replied Colonel       Fitzwilliam. But so we all do. It is only that he has better       means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many       others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must       be inured to self-denial and dependence. In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little       of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial       and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money       from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a       fancy for? These are home questionsand perhaps I cannot say that I have       experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of       greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons       cannot marry where they like. Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very       often do. Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not       many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some       attention to money. Is this, thought Elizabeth, meant for me? and she coloured at       the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, And       pray, what is the usual price of an earls younger son? Unless       the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask       above fifty thousand pounds. He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To       interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with       what had passed, she soon afterwards said: I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the       sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not       marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But,       perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is       under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her. No, said Colonel Fitzwilliam, that is an advantage which he       must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of       Miss Darcy.\nAre you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make?       Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age       are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the       true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way. As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the       manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss       Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she       had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly       replied: You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I       dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.       She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my       acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard       you say that you know them. I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike       manhe is a great friend of Darcys. Oh! yes, said Elizabeth drily; Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to       Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him. Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him       in those points where he most wants care. From something that he       told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley       very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I       have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It       was all conjecture. What is it you mean? It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally       known, because if it were to get round to the ladys family, it       would be an unpleasant thing. You may depend upon my not mentioning it. And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be       Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated       himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences       of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any       other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from       believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that       sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of       last summer. Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference? I understood that there were some very strong objections against       the lady. And what arts did he use to separate them? He did not talk to me of his own arts, said Fitzwilliam,       smiling. He only told me what I have now told you. Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with       indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her       why she was so thoughtful. I am thinking of what you have been telling me, said she. Your       cousins conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the       judge? You are rather disposed to call his interference officious? I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety       of his friends inclination, or why, upon his own judgement       alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend       was to be happy. But, she continued, recollecting herself, as       we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.       It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the       case. That is not an unnatural surmise, said Fitzwilliam, but it is       a lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly. This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a       picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an       answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked       on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There,       shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she       could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It       was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than       those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the       world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless       influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to       separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had       always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and       arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead       him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of       all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had       ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most       affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say       how lasting an evil he might have inflicted. There were some very strong objections against the lady, were       Colonel Fitzwilliams words; and those strong objections probably       were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and       another who was in business in London. To Jane herself, she exclaimed, there could be no possibility       of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!her       understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners       captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father,       who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy       himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will       probably never reach. When she thought of her mother, her       confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any       objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose       pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the       want of importance in his friends connections, than from their       want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had       been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by       the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister. The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on       a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that,       added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her       not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to       drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did       not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband       from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his       apprehension of Lady Catherines being rather displeased by her       staying at home.  Chapter 34 When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate       herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her       employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had       written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual       complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any       communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost       every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which       had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding       from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly       disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.       Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of       uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the       first perusal. Mr. Darcys shameful boast of what misery he had       been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sisters       sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to       Rosings was to end on the day after the nextand, a still       greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with       Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her       spirits, by all that affection could do. She could not think of Darcys leaving Kent without remembering       that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had       made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as       he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him. While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound       of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the       idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once       before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire       particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her       spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter       amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried       manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing       his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered       him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then       getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but       said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came       towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began: In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not       be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire       and love you. Elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression. She stared,       coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient       encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long       felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were       feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was       not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His       sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family       obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on       with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was       wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be       insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection, and       though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at       first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to       resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in       anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with       patience, when he should have done. He concluded with       representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in       spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer;       and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her       acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see       that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of       apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real       security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and,       when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said: In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to       express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however       unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation       should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now       thank you. But I cannotI have never desired your good opinion,       and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry       to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously       done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings       which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of       your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after       this explanation. Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes       fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less       resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger,       and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He       was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not       open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The       pause was to Elizabeths feelings dreadful. At length, with a       voice of forced calmness, he said: And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of       expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so       little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of       small importance. I might as well enquire, replied she, why with so evident a       desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that       you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even       against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility,       if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I       have. Had not my feelings decided against youhad they been       indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that       any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been       the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most       beloved sister? As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the       emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to       interrupt her while she continued: I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive       can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You       dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if       not the only means of dividing them from each otherof exposing       one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and       the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving       them both in misery of the acutest kind. She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was       listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any       feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of       affected incredulity. Can you deny that you have done it? she repeated. With assumed tranquillity he then replied: I have no wish of       denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend       from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_       I have been kinder than towards myself. Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil       reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to       conciliate her. But it is not merely this affair, she continued, on which my       dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of       you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which       I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject,       what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can       you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you       here impose upon others? You take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns, said       Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour. Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling       an interest in him? His misfortunes! repeated Darcy contemptuously; yes, his       misfortunes have been great indeed. And of your infliction, cried Elizabeth with energy. You have       reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty.       You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been       designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of       that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You       have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his       misfortune with contempt and ridicule. And this, cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the       room, is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you       hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,       according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,       added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, these       offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt       by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented       my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might       have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my       struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled       by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection,       by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor       am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and       just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your       connections?to congratulate myself on the hope of relations,       whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own? Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she       tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said: You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of       your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared       me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you       behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner. She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she       continued: You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible       way that would have tempted me to accept it. Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an       expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on: From the very beginningfrom the first moment, I may almost       sayof my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with       the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your       selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form       the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have       built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month       before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I       could ever be prevailed on to marry. You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your       feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have       been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and       accept my best wishes for your health and happiness. And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth       heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how       to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried       for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had       passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should       receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have       been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to       wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made       him prevent his friends marrying her sister, and which must       appear at least with equal force in his own casewas almost       incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so       strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pridehis       shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Janehis       unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not       justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned       Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to       deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his       attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very       agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherines carriage       made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlottes       observation, and hurried her away to her room.  Chapter 35\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and       meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not       yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was       impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for       employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge       herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her       favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcys sometimes       coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she       turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The       park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon       passed one of the gates into the ground. After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she       was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the       gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now       passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and       every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was       on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of       a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was       moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was       directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near       enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,       pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself       called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she       moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it       also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took,       said, with a look of haughty composure, I have been walking in       the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me       the honour of reading that letter? And then, with a slight bow,       turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight. With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest       curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still       increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of       letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The       envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the       lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight       oclock in the morning, and was as follows: Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the       apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments       or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to       you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling       myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,       cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation       and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been       spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.       You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your       attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but       I demand it of your justice. Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of       equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first       mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I       had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I       had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and       humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the       prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown       off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my       father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on       our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its       exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two       young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few       weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that       blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each       circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the       following account of my actions and their motives has been read.       If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am       under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive       to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be       obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common       with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any       other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening       of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his       feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love       before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you,       I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucass accidental       information, that Bingleys attentions to your sister had given       rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it       as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.       From that moment I observed my friends behaviour attentively;       and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was       beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also       watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging       as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I       remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny, that though she       received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by       any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken       here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of       your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have       been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment       has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,       that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such       as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,       however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily       touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is       certainbut I will venture to say that my investigation and       decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did       not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed       it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My       objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last       night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion       to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be       so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other       causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and       existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself       endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before       me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of       your mothers family, though objectionable, was nothing in       comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so       almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger       sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It       pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects       of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this       representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider       that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of       the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and       your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and       disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what       passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and       every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to       preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy       connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,       as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon       returning.\nThe part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters       uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence       of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time       was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on       joining him directly in London. We accordingly wentand there I       readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the       certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them       earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or       delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would       ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded       by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sisters       indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection       with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great       natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than       on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived       himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against       returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been       given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself       for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in       the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it       is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to       conceal from him your sisters being in town. I knew it myself,       as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet       ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence       is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough       extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this       concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,       and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more       to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your       sisters feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives       which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient,       I have not yet learnt to condemn them. With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having       injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you       the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has       _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what       I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted       veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for       many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose       good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my       father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was       his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My       father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridgemost       important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the       extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a       gentlemans education. My father was not only fond of this young       mans society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also       the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his       profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it       is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very       different manner. The vicious propensitiesthe want of principle,       which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best       friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly       the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing       him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here       again I shall give you painto what degree you only can tell. But       whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a       suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his       real characterit adds even another motive. My excellent father died about five years ago; and his       attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his       will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his       advancement in the best manner that his profession might       allowand if he took orders, desired that a valuable family       living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a       legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long       survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.       Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against       taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for       him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of       the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some       intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that       the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient       support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be       sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his       proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;       the business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to       assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be       in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three       thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved.       I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his       society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his       studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all       restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For       about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of       the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he       applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His       circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in       believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most       unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being       ordained, if I would present him to the living in questionof       which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well       assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could       not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions. You will       hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for       resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in       proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was       doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his       reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of       acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last       summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget       myself, and which no obligation less than the present should       induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I       feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten       years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mothers       nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she       was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in       London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over       it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly       by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance       between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most       unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far       recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart       retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child,       that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent       to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her       excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that       I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly       a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana,       unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother       whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole       to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my       sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I       wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.       Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickhams chief       object was unquestionably my sisters fortune, which is thirty       thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of       revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge       would have been complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we       have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject       it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty       towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form       of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not       perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of       everything concerning either, detection could not be in your       power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.\nYou may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last       night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what       could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here       related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of       Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant       intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my fathers       will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of       these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_       assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause       from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the       possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some       opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of       the morning. I will only add, God bless you. FITZWILLIAM DARCY  Chapter 36 If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect       it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no       expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may       well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a       contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read       were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first       understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and       steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation       to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a       strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his       account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an       eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from       impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was       incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.       His belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved       to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to       the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him       justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which       satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was       all pride and insolence. But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.       Wickhamwhen she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation       of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion       of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own       history of himselfher feelings were yet more acutely painful and       more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and       even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely,       repeatedly exclaiming, This must be false! This cannot be! This       must be the grossest falsehood!and when she had gone through       the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last       page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not       regard it, that she would never look in it again. In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on       nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the       letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she       could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related       to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the       meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the       Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the       kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known       its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each       recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the       difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was       fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was       impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side       or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that       her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the       closest attention, the particulars immediately following of       Wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living, of his       receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds,       again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter,       weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be       impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut       with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again       she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,       which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could       so represent as to render Mr. Darcys conduct in it less than       infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely       blameless throughout the whole. The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to       lay at Mr. Wickhams charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more       so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never       heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia, in       which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on       meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight       acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in       Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character,       had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of       enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him       at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect       some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity       or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.       Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for       those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what       Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years       continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could       see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address;       but she could remember no more substantial good than the general       approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social       powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a       considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas!       the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received       some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel       Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she       was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel       Fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the       information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs, and       whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she       had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked       by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly       banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have       hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his       cousins corroboration. She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in       conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening       at Mr. Phillipss. Many of his expressions were still fresh in       her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such       communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her       before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he       had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his       conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of       seeing Mr. Darcythat Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that       _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield       ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the       Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story       to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been       everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples       in sinking Mr. Darcys character, though he had assured her that       respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son. How differently did everything now appear in which he was       concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence       of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of       her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but       his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself       could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been       deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his       vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had       most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour       grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.       Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned       by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;       that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in       the whole course of their acquaintancean acquaintance which had       latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of       intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be       unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him of irreligious or       immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed       and valuedthat even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother,       and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his       sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had       his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a       violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed       from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of       it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor       Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,       partial, prejudiced, absurd. How despicably I have acted! she cried; I, who have prided       myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my       abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my       sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!       How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation!       Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!       But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the       preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on       the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted       prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either       were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself. From herself to Janefrom Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a       line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcys       explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read       it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.       How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,       which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared       himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment;       and she could not help remembering what Charlottes opinion had       always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his       description of Jane. She felt that Janes feelings, though       fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant       complacency in her air and manner not often united with great       sensibility. When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were       mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her       sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her       too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he       particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball,       and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have       made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers. The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It       soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had       thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she       considered that Janes disappointment had in fact been the work       of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit       of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt       depressed beyond anything she had ever known before. After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every       variety of thoughtre-considering events, determining       probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to       a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection       of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she       entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,       and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make       her unfit for conversation. She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had       each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few       minutes, to take leavebut that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been       sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and       almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.       Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she       really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an       object; she could think only of her letter.  Chapter 37 The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins       having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting       obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of       their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits       as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone       through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady       Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with       great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that       she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having       them all to dine with her. Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,       had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to       her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of       what her ladyships indignation would have been. What would she       have said? how would she have behaved? were questions with which       she amused herself. Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. I       assure you, I feel it exceedingly, said Lady Catherine; I       believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I       am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be       so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so       they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably       till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,       more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings       certainly increases. Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,       which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter. Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed       out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by       supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she       added: But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg       that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad       of your company, I am sure. I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,       replied Elizabeth, but it is not in my power to accept it. I       must be in town next Saturday. Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I       expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before       you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs.       Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight. But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return. Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.       Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if       you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to       take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in       June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the       barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of youand       indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not       object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large. You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our       original plan. Lady Catherine seemed resigned. Mrs. Collins, you must send a       servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot       bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.       It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have       the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young       women should always be properly guarded and attended, according       to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to       Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two       men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy,       of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with       propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to       all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.       Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would       really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone. My uncle is to send a servant for us. Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad       you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you       change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at       the Bell, you will be attended to. Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their       journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention       was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or,       with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.       Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was       alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day       went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in       all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\nMr. Darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by       heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its       writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the       style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when       she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,       her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed       feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited       gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not       approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or       feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own       past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and       regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of       yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father,       contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to       restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her       mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely       insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane       in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;       but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence, what       chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,       irritable, and completely under Lydias guidance, had been always       affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,       would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and       vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt       with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they       would be going there forever. Anxiety on Janes behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.       Darcys explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good       opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His       affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct       cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness       of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the       thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so       replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been       deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! When to these recollections was added the development of       Wickhams character, it may be easily believed that the happy       spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much       affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear       tolerably cheerful. Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last       week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening       was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into       the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the       best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of       placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself       obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and       pack her trunk afresh. When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,       wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford       again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to       curtsey and hold out her hand to both.  Chapter 38 On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a       few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the       opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed       indispensably necessary. I know not, Miss Elizabeth, said he, whether Mrs. Collins has       yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I       am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving       her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt,       I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our       humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few       domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford       extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will       believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done       everything in our power to prevent your spending your time       unpleasantly. Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.       She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of       being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received,       must make _her_ feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and       with a more smiling solemnity replied: It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your       time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most       fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very       superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the       frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may       flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been       entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherines       family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing       which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see       how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge       that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I       should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion,       while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings. Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he       was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to       unite civility and truth in a few short sentences. You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into       Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you       will be able to do so. Lady Catherines great attentions to Mrs.       Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust       it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut       on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure       you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most       cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte       and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in       everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas       between us. We seem to have been designed for each other. Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where       that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she       firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was       not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by       the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy       to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes       open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to       go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her       housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent       concerns, had not yet lost their charms. At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the       parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After       an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was       attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down       the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all       her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had       received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr.       and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria       followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he       suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had       hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at       Rosings. But, he added, you will of course wish to have your humble       respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their       kindness to you while you have been here. Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be       shut, and the carriage drove off. Good gracious! cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, it       seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many       things have happened! A great many indeed, said her companion with a sigh. We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there       twice! How much I shall have to tell! Elizabeth added privately, And how much I shall have to       conceal! Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any       alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they       reached Mr. Gardiners house, where they were to remain a few       days. Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of       studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the       kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go       home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for       observation. It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even       for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcys       proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would       so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so       highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been       able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing       could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she       remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her       fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into       repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister       further.  Chapter 39\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies       set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of , in       Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.       Bennets carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in       token of the coachmans punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking       out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an       hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite       milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad       and cucumber. After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a       table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually       affords, exclaiming, Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable       surprise? And we mean to treat you all, added Lydia, but you must lend       us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.       Then, showing her purchasesLook here, I have bought this       bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might       as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get       home, and see if I can make it up any better. And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect       unconcern, Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the       shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim       it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it       will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the       shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight. Are they indeed! cried Elizabeth, with the greatest       satisfaction. They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want       papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a       delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at       all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a       miserable summer else we shall have! Yes, thought Elizabeth, _that_ would be a delightful scheme       indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton,       and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset       already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of       Meryton! Now I have got some news for you, said Lydia, as they sat down       at table. What do you think? It is excellent newscapital       newsand about a certain person we all like! Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told       he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said: Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You       thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he       often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is       an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long       chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear       Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger       of Wickhams marrying Mary King. Theres for you! She is gone       down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe. And Mary King is safe! added Elizabeth; safe from a connection       imprudent as to fortune. She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him. But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side, said       Jane. I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never       cared three straws about herwho _could_ about such a nasty       little freckled thing? Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such       coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the       _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had harboured       and fancied liberal! As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was       ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all       their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition       of Kittys and Lydias purchases, were seated in it. How nicely we are all crammed in, cried Lydia. I am glad I       bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another       bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk       and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear       what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen       any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes       that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.       Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost       three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being       married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to       get husbands, you cant think. She says Lizzy had better have       taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any       fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of       you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear       me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel       Forsters. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.       Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the       bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked       the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was       forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We       dressed up Chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for       a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel       and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were       forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how       well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or       three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the       least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I       should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and       then they soon found out what was the matter. With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did       Lydia, assisted by Kittys hints and additions, endeavour to       amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened       as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent       mention of Wickhams name. Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to       see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner       did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth: I am glad you are come back, Lizzy. Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the       Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were       the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was enquiring of       Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.       Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of       the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and,       on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and       Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other persons, was       enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who       would hear her. Oh! Mary, said she, I wish you had gone with us, for we had       such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and       pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone       so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to       the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated       the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and       if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then       when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have       got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we       were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,       that anybody might have heard us ten miles off! To this Mary very gravely replied, Far be it from me, my dear       sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be       congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they       would have no charms for _me_I should infinitely prefer a book. But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to       anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary       at all. In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to       walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth       steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss       Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in       pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her       opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was       resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_ of       the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.       In a fortnight they were to goand once gone, she hoped there       could be nothing more to plague her on his account. She had not been many hours at home before she found that the       Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn,       was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw       directly that her father had not the smallest intention of       yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and       equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never       yet despaired of succeeding at last.  Chapter 40 Elizabeths impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened       could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress       every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing       her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the       chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\nMiss Bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong       sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear       perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other       feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his       sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but       still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters       refusal must have given him. His being so sure of succeeding was wrong, said she, and       certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it       must increase his disappointment! Indeed, replied Elizabeth, I am heartily sorry for him; but he       has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his       regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him? Blame you! Oh, no. But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham? NoI do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did. But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very       next day. She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents       as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this       for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world       without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole       race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was       Darcys vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of       consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour       to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one       without involving the other. This will not do, said Elizabeth; you never will be able to       make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you       must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of       merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and       of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am       inclined to believe it all Darcys; but you shall do as you       choose. It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from       Jane. I do not know when I have been more shocked, said she. Wickham       so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear       Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a       disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!       and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too       distressing. I am sure you must feel it so. Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you       so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that       I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your       profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much       longer, my heart will be as light as a feather. Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his       countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner! There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of       those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other       all the appearance of it. I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it       as you used to do. And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a       dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to ones       genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.       One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but       one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then       stumbling on something witty. Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not       treat the matter as you do now. Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say       unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane       to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain       and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you! How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong       expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they       _do_ appear wholly undeserved. Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a       most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been       encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I       want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our       acquaintances in general understand Wickhams character. Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, Surely there can       be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your       opinion? That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised       me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every       particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as       possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to       the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general       prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the       death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him       in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be       gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he       really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we       may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present       I will say nothing about it. You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin       him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and       anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him       desperate. The tumult of Elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation.       She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her       for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,       whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was       still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the       disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcys       letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been       valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could       partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect       understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing       off this last encumbrance of mystery. And then, said she, if       that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely       be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable       manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till       it has lost all its value! She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the       real state of her sisters spirits. Jane was not happy. She still       cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even       fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of       first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater       steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so       fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every       other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the       feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence       of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health       and their tranquillity. Well, Lizzy, said Mrs. Bennet one day, what is your opinion       _now_ of this sad business of Janes? For my part, I am       determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my       sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane       saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving       young manand I do not suppose theres the least chance in the       world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming       to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of       everybody, too, who is likely to know. I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more. Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come.       Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and       if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort       is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will       be sorry for what he has done. But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such       expectation, she made no answer. Well, Lizzy, continued her mother, soon afterwards, and so the       Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope       it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is       an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her       mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in       _their_ housekeeping, I dare say. No, nothing at all. A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes.       _They_ will take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will       never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!       And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your       father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say,       whenever that happens. It was a subject which they could not mention before me. No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt       they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be       easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the       better. _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only       entailed on me.  Chapter 41\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.       It was the last of the regiments stay in Meryton, and all the       young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The       dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were       still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course       of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for       this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was       extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in       any of the family. Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do? would       they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. How can you be       smiling so, Lizzy? Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered       what she had herself endured on a similar occasion,       five-and-twenty years ago. I am sure, said she, I cried for two days together when       Colonel Millers regiment went away. I thought I should have       broken my heart. I am sure I shall break _mine_, said Lydia. If one could but go to Brighton! observed Mrs. Bennet. Oh, yes!if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so       disagreeable. A little sea-bathing would set me up forever. And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of       good, added Kitty. Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through       Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all       sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of       Mr. Darcys objections; and never had she been so much disposed       to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. But the gloom of Lydias prospect was shortly cleared away; for       she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the       colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This       invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately       married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had       recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_       months acquaintance they had been intimate _two_. The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.       Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of       Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her       sisters feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless       ecstasy, calling for everyones congratulations, and laughing and       talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty       continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as       unreasonable as her accent was peevish. I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as       Lydia, said she, Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I       have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for       I am two years older. In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to       make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was       so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother       and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all       possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as       such a step must make her were it known, she could not help       secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented       to him all the improprieties of Lydias general behaviour, the       little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a       woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more       imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the       temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her       attentively, and then said: Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some       public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with       so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the       present circumstances. If you were aware, said Elizabeth, of the very great       disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of       Lydias unguarded and imprudent mannernay, which has already       arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the       affair. Already arisen? repeated Mr. Bennet. What, has she frightened       away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast       down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a       little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the       list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydias       folly. Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It       is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now       complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must       be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of       all restraint which mark Lydias character. Excuse me, for I must       speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble       of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her       present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will       soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be       fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt       that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in       the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any       attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the       ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off       any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for       admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is       comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,       ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father,       can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and       despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not       be often involved in the disgrace? Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and       affectionately taking her hand said in reply: Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are       known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear       to less advantage for having a couple ofor I may say, threevery       silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does       not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a       sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she       is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At       Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt       than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth       their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may       teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow       many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the       rest of her life. With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own       opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and       sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her       vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having       performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or       augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition. Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference       with her father, their indignation would hardly have found       expression in their united volubility. In Lydias imagination, a       visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly       happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets       of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself       the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present       unknown. She saw all the glories of the campits tents stretched       forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young       and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the       view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting       with at least six officers at once. Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects       and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?       They could have been understood only by her mother, who might       have felt nearly the same. Lydias going to Brighton was all that       consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husbands never       intending to go there himself. But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their       raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of       Lydias leaving home. Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having       been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation       was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality       entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very       gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a       sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to       herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the       inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which       had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,       after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern       for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such       idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed       it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing,       that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had       been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference       secured at any time by their renewal.\nOn the very last day of the regiments remaining at Meryton, he       dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little       was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on       his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had       passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliams and Mr.       Darcys having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him,       if he was acquainted with the former. He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moments       recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly       seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very       gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer       was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon       afterwards added: How long did you say he was at Rosings? Nearly three weeks. And you saw him frequently? Yes, almost every day. His manners are very different from his cousins. Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon       acquaintance. Indeed! cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.       And pray, may I ask? But checking himself, he added, in a       gayer tone, Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to       add aught of civility to his ordinary style?for I dare not       hope, he continued in a lower and more serious tone, that he is       improved in essentials. Oh, no! said Elizabeth. In essentials, I believe, he is very       much what he ever was. While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to       rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a       something in her countenance which made him listen with an       apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added: When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean       that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but       that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better       understood. Wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and       agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off       his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the       gentlest of accents: You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily       comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to       assume even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that       direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others,       for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have       suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which       you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his       visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands       much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when       they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish       of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain       he has very much at heart. Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered       only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted       to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was       in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with       the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no       further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last       with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never       meeting again. When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to       Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.       The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than       pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep       from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good       wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her       injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying       herself as much as possibleadvice which there was every reason       to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous       happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle       adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.  Chapter 42 Had Elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family, she       could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal       felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and       beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty       generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and       illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all       real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had       vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were       overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek       comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had       brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the       unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the       country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his       principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise       indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his       amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in       general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of       entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive       benefit from such as are given. Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of       her fathers behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with       pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his       affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what       she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that       continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in       exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so       highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now       the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable       a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising       from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which,       rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of       his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his       wife. When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickhams departure she found       little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.       Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home       she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the       dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their       domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her       natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were       removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil       might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly       and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a       watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found,       what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she       had looked forward with impatient desire did not, in taking       place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It       was consequently necessary to name some other period for the       commencement of actual felicityto have some other point on which       her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the       pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and       prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now       the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation       for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her       mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included       Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect. But it is fortunate, thought she, that I have something to       wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment       would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless       source of regret in my sisters absence, I may reasonably hope to       have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which       every part promises delight can never be successful; and general       disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little       peculiar vexation. When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very       minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always       long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother       contained little else than that they were just returned from the       library, where such and such officers had attended them, and       where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite       wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would       have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a       violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going       off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister,       there was still less to be learntfor her letters to Kitty,       though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words       to be made public.\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,       good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.       Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in       town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer       engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual       querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much       recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event       of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the       following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not       to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and       malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should       be quartered in Meryton. The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now       fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a       letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its       commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be       prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in       July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that       left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as       they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and       comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the       Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to       the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than       Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy       the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a       peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly       passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a       few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all       the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the       Peak. Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on       seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time       enough. But it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her       temper to be happy; and all was soon right again. With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.       It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of       Pemberley and its owner. But surely, said she, I may enter his       county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without       his perceiving me. The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to       pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival. But they did pass       away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at       length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and       eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the       particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general       favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly       adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them,       playing with them, and loving them. The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the       next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.       One enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companions; a       suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear       inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand       affection and intelligence, which might supply it among       themselves if there were disappointments abroad. It is not the object of this work to give a description of       Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which       their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,       Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of       Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of       Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiners former residence, and where       she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they       bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of       the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found       from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their       direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking       over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an       inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his       willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation. My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have       heard so much? said her aunt; a place, too, with which so many       of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth       there, you know. Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at       Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing       it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after       going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or       satin curtains. Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. If it were merely a fine       house richly furnished, said she, I should not care about it       myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the       finest woods in the country. Elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce. The       possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,       instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very       idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt       than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;       and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if       her private enquiries to the absence of the family were       unfavourably answered. Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid       whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name       of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family       were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the       last questionand her alarms now being removed, she was at       leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house       herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and       she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper       air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the       scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.  Chapter 43 Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance       of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length       they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter. The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.       They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some       time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent. Elizabeths mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and       admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually       ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of       a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was       instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite       side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.       It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising       ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,       a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but       without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal       nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen       a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty       had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were       all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt       that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the       door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all       her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest       the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,       they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited       for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she       was. The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much       less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding       her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,       well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after       slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.       The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving       increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.       Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the       whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the       winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with       delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were       taking different positions; but from every window there were       beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their       furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but       Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither       gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real       elegance, than the furniture of Rosings. And of this place, thought she, I might have been mistress!       With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!       Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in       them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and       aunt. But no,recollecting herselfthat could never be; my       uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been       allowed to invite them. This was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very       like regret.\nShe longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was       really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,       the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with       alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, But we       expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends. How       rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any       circumstance been delayed a day! Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and       saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other       miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly,       how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it       was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late masters       steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. He       is now gone into the army, she added; but I am afraid he has       turned out very wild. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth       could not return it. And that, said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the       miniatures, is my masterand very like him. It was drawn at the       same time as the otherabout eight years ago. I have heard much of your masters fine person, said Mrs.       Gardiner, looking at the picture; it is a handsome face. But,       Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not. Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this       intimation of her knowing her master. Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy? Elizabeth coloured, and said: A little. And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, maam? Yes, very handsome. I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up       stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.       This room was my late masters favourite room, and these       miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of       them. This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickhams being among them. Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,       drawn when she was only eight years old. And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother? said Mrs.       Gardiner. Oh! yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so       accomplished!She plays and sings all day long. In the next room       is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my       master; she comes here to-morrow with him. Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,       encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks;       Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great       pleasure in talking of her master and his sister. Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year? Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend       half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer       months. Except, thought Elizabeth, when she goes to Ramsgate. If your master would marry, you might see more of him. Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know       who is good enough for him. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,       It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think       so. I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows       him, replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty       far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the       housekeeper added, I have never known a cross word from him in       my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old. This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite       to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her       firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed       to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying: There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are       lucky in having such a master. Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I       could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that       they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when       they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most       generous-hearted boy in the world. Elizabeth almost stared at her. Can this be Mr. Darcy? thought       she. His father was an excellent man, said Mrs. Gardiner. Yes, maam, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like       himjust as affable to the poor. Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for       more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She       related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the       rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner,       highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he       attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led       again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many       merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase. He is the best landlord, and the best master, said she, that       ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of       nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or       servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him       proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it       is only because he does not rattle away like other young men. In what an amiable light does this place him! thought       Elizabeth. This fine account of him, whispered her aunt as they walked,       is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend. Perhaps we might be deceived. That is not very likely; our authority was too good. On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very       pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and       lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it       was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a       liking to the room when last at Pemberley. He is certainly a good brother, said Elizabeth, as she walked       towards one of the windows. Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcys delight, when she should       enter the room. And this is always the way with him, she added.       Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in       a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her. The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,       were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good       paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such       as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to       look at some drawings of Miss Darcys, in crayons, whose subjects       were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible. In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could       have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked       in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.       At last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance to       Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to       have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several       minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and       returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs.       Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers       lifetime. There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeths mind, a more       gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at       the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on       him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is       more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a       brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many peoples       happiness were in his guardianship!how much of pleasure or pain       was it in his power to bestow!how much of good or evil must be       done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the       housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood       before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes       upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment       of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its       warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression. When all of the house that was open to general inspection had       been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the       housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at       the hall-door. As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth       turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and       while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,       the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,       which led behind it to the stables. They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was       his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their       eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with       the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed       immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced       towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of       perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,       received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be       overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the       picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure       the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardeners       expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately       have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to       their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift       her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to       his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of       his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered       was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the       impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the       few minutes in which they continued were some of the most       uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;       when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and       he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left       Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so       hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts. At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a       few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected       himself, and took leave. The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his       figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by       her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered       by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,       the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must       appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so       vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself       in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come       a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes       sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his       discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment       arrivedthat moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She       blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And       his behaviour, so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean? That he       should even speak to her was amazing!but to speak with such       civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she       seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with       such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast       did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his       letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to       account for it. They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,       and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a       finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it       was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,       though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her       uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as       they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her       thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,       whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to       know what at the moment was passing in his mindin what manner he       thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was       still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt       himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was       not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in       seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her       with composure. At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence       of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more       like herself. They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a       while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where       the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many       charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long       range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the       stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole       park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant       smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the       matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought       them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to       the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They       crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air       of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet       visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed       room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough       coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its       windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived       their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great       walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the       carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,       obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on       the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but       their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to       indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much       engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in       the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced       but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were       again surprised, and Elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to       what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching       them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less       sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before       they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more       prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and       to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a       few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into       some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk       concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was       immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost       none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she       began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she       had not got beyond the words delightful, and charming, when       some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise       of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her       colour changed, and she said no more. Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,       he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to       her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was       quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his       being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people       against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.       What will be his surprise, thought she, when he knows who they       are? He takes them now for people of fashion. The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named       their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to       see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his       decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.       That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he       sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going       away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with       Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but       triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some       relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most       attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every       expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his       intelligence, his taste, or his good manners. The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.       Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as       often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,       offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and       pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually       most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with       Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said       nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be       all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and       continually was she repeating, Why is he so altered? From what       can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_it cannot be for _my_ sake       that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could       not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should       still love me.\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the       two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending       to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some       curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It       originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the       morning, found Elizabeths arm inadequate to her support, and       consequently preferred her husbands. Mr. Darcy took her place by       her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,       the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been       assured of his absence before she came to the place, and       accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very       unexpectedfor your housekeeper, she added, informed us that       you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,       before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not       immediately expected in the country. He acknowledged the truth       of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned       his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with       whom he had been travelling. They will join me early to-morrow,       he continued, and among them are some who will claim an       acquaintance with youMr. Bingley and his sisters. Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were       instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingleys name had       been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by       his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged. There is also one other person in the party, he continued after       a pause, who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will       you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to       your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton? The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too       great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She       immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of       being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,       without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying       to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of       her. They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.       Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was       flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her       was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the       others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.       Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind. He then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself       not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time       much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She       wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every       subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,       and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.       Yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas       were nearly worn out before the _tte--tte_ was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go       into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,       and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy       handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,       Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house. The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of       them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they       had expected. He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and       unassuming, said her uncle. There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,       replied her aunt, but it is confined to his air, and is not       unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some       people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it. I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was       more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no       necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was       very trifling. To be sure, Lizzy, said her aunt, he is not so handsome as       Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickhams countenance, for his       features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he       was so disagreeable? Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had       liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that       she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,       replied her uncle. Your great men often are; and therefore I       shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind       another day, and warn me off his grounds. Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his       character, but said nothing. From what we have seen of him, continued Mrs. Gardiner, I       really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so       cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not       an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing       about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity       in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea       of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his       house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help       laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,       and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue. Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in       vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them       to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what       she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were       capable of a very different construction; and that his character       was by no means so faulty, nor Wickhams so amiable, as they had       been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she       related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in       which they had been connected, without actually naming her       authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on. Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now       approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave       way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in       pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its       environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by       the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off       again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was       spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many       years discontinuance. The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave       Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she       could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcys       civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted       with his sister.  Chapter 44 Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to       visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was       consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole       of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very       morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They       had been walking about the place with some of their new friends,       and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining       with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a       window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving       up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery,       guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her       surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour       which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and       the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the       circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the       preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing       had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no       other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter       than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these       newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation       of Elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing. She was       quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of       disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should       have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious       to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing       would fail her. She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she       walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw       such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made       everything worse. Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable       introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that       her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.       Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was       exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes       convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it       difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,       though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her       appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her       brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her       manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had       expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as       ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such       different feelings. They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that       Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time       to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when       Bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he       entered the room. All Elizabeths anger against him had been long       done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood       its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he       expressed himself on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly,       though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with       the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done. To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting       personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The       whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The       suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece       directed their observation towards each with an earnest though       guarded enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full       conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of       the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that       the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough. Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain       the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her       own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter       object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of       success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were       prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was       eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased. In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;       and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his       were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he       talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased       herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying       to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she       could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had       been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side       that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that       could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon       satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere       they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a       recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of       saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.       He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking       together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that       it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing       her; and, before she could reply, he added, It is above eight       months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were       all dancing together at Netherfield. Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he       afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of       the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was       not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there       was a look and a manner which gave them meaning. It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy       himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an       expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she       heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his       companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners       which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence       might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus       seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people       with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a       disgracewhen she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to       the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected       their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonagethe difference, the       change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she       could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never,       even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his       dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to       please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as       now, when no importance could result from the success of his       endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his       attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and       censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings. Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they       arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in       expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss       Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.       Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in       the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner       looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the       invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance,       but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that       this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment       than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who       was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she       ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next       was fixed on. Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing       Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and       many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.       Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak       of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some       others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of       considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though       while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager       to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and       aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their       favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress. But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiners curiosity;       it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident       that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had       before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love       with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify       enquiry. Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,       as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.       They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn       his character from their own feelings and his servants report,       without any reference to any other account, the circle in       Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it       for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing       the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority       of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and       whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily       rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of       their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.       They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably       had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants       of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was       acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much       good among the poor. With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was       not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his       concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood,       it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he       had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards       discharged.\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening       more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it       seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings       towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours       endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him.       No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been       ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so       called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable       qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some       time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now       heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony       so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in       so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,       above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of       goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;       gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving       her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony       of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations       accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would       avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental       meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any       indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where       their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good       opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his       sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only       astonishment but gratitudefor to love, ardent love, it must be       attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be       encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be       exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to       him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted       to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself,       and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should       employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed,       of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses. It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the       niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcys in coming to       see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had       reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though       it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their       side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to       wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were,       therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked       herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply. Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme       had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made       of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.  Chapter 45 Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingleys dislike of her       had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how       unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was       curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the       acquaintance would now be renewed. On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the       saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.       Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing       view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the       beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over       the intermediate lawn. In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting       there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom       she lived in London. Georgianas reception of them was very       civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though       proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily       give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her       being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however,       did her justice, and pitied her. By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a       curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such       pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first       broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman,       whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to       be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between       her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the       conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished       for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a       short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard. Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss       Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss       Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not       have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they       not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not       sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts       were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the       gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the       master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished       or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in       this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingleys       voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry       after the health of her family. She answered with equal       indifference and brevity, and the other said no more. The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the       entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all       the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till       after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to       Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was       now employment for the whole partyfor though they could not all       talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,       nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table. While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding       whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.       Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;       and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes       to predominate, she began to regret that he came. He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three       other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had       left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended       a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than       Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;       a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the       more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the       whole party were awakened against them, and that there was       scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first       came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so       strongly marked as in Miss Bingleys, in spite of the smiles       which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its       objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her       attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her       brothers entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and       Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to       get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt       at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this       likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first       opportunity of saying, with sneering civility: Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the shire Militia removed from       Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\nIn Darcys presence she dared not mention Wickhams name; but       Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her       thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave       her a moments distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel       the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a       tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance       showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking       at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to       lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then       giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained       from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose       Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she       believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which       might injure her in Darcys opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the       latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of       her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had       ever reached her of Miss Darcys meditated elopement. To no       creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except       to Elizabeth; and from all Bingleys connections her brother was       particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which       Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming       hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and       without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate       him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something       to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. Elizabeths collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his       emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not       approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,       though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother,       whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest       in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed       to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on       her more and more cheerfully. Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer       above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their       carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on       Elizabeths person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not       join her. Her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her       favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such       terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of       finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy       returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to       him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,       she cried; I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she       is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and       I were agreeing that we should not have known her again. However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he       contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other       alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous       consequence of travelling in the summer. For my own part, she rejoined, I must confess that I never       could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion       has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her       nose wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines. Her       teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for       her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never       see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish       look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there       is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable. Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this       was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people       are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat       nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely       silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak,       she continued: I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed       we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I       particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been       dining at Netherfield, _She_ a beauty!I should as soon call her       mother a wit. But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I       believe you thought her rather pretty at one time. Yes, replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, but       _that_ was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since       I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my       acquaintance. He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the       satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any       pain but herself. Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred       during their visit, as they returned, except what had       particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of       everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who       had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister,       his friends, his house, his fruitof everything but himself; yet       Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him,       and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces       beginning the subject.  Chapter 46 Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a       letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this       disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had       now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and       her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at       once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent       elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written       the direction remarkably ill. They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and       her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off       by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had       been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of       all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the       country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day       later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important       intelligence. It was to this effect: Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred       of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of       alarming yoube assured that we are all well. What I have to say       relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just       as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us       that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to       own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty,       however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very       sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to       hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.       Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this       step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His       choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can       give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father       bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know       what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They       were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were       not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent       off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten       miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here       soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their       intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor       mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I       hardly know what I have written. Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely       knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter       instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost       impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than       the conclusion of the first.\nBy this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried       letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not       confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer       for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would       write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.       Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia       would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place,       for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to       Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton       the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydias       short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were       going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing       his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia       at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking       the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did       trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering       that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the       chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this       is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not       what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side       London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing       them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and       Hatfield, but without any successno such people had been seen to       pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,       and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to       his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one       can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very       great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think       so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for       them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first       plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young       woman of Lydias connections, which is not likely, can I suppose       her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,       that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he       shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.       was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and       keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but       this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my       life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having       concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,       one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have       been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as       the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?       I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if       inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have       just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I       cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as       possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not       afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to       ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel       Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I       am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him       to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel       Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In       such an exigence, my uncles advice and assistance would be       everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I       must feel, and I rely upon his goodness. Oh! where, where is my uncle? cried Elizabeth, darting from her       seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,       without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she       reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy       appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and       before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind       every idea was superseded by Lydias situation, hastily       exclaimed, I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find       Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I       have not an instant to lose. Good God! what is the matter? cried he, with more feeling than       politeness; then recollecting himself, I will not detain you a       minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.       Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself. Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she       felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.       Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though       in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to       fetch his master and mistress home instantly. On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself,       and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to       leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and       commiseration, Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could       take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you       one? You are very ill. No, I thank you, she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.       There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only       distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from       Longbourn. She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes       could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could       only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her       in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. I have just       had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be       concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her       friendshas eloped; has thrown herself into the power ofof Mr.       Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him       too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,       nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever. Darcy was fixed in astonishment. When I consider, she added in       a yet more agitated voice, that _I_ might have prevented it! _I_       who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it       onlysome part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his       character been known, this could not have happened. But it is       allall too late now. I am grieved indeed, cried Darcy; grievedshocked. But is it       certainabsolutely certain? Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were       traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not       gone to Scotland. And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover       her? My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my       uncles immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in       half-an-hour. But nothing can be doneI know very well that       nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are       they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is       every way horrible! Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence. When _my_ eyes were opened to his real characterOh! had I known       what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew notI was afraid of       doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake! Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was       walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow       contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and       instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything _must_       sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of       the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but       the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to       her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the       contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own       wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have       loved him, as now, when all love must be vain. But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.       Lydiathe humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all,       soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with       her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else;       and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a       sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a       manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise       restraint, said, I am afraid you have been long desiring my       absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but       real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything       could be either said or done on my part that might offer       consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with       vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.       This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sisters having       the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day. Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say       that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the       unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be       long. He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow       for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was       at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her       relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that       they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality       as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she       threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their       acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at       the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted       its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its       termination. If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,       Elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor       faulty. But if otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is       unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often       described as arising on a first interview with its object, and       even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in       her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the       latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill       success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less       interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go       with regret; and in this early example of what Lydias infamy       must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that       wretched business. Never, since reading Janes second letter, had       she entertained a hope of Wickhams meaning to marry her. No one       but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an       expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this       development. While the contents of the first letter remained in       her mind, she was all surpriseall astonishment that Wickham       should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for       money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared       incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an       attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though       she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an       elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no       difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her       understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,       that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that       Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.       Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite,       as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections       had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The       mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a       girloh! how acutely did she now feel it! She was wild to be at hometo hear, to see, to be upon the spot       to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon       her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable       of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost       persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncles       interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered       the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had       hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servants account that       their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly       on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their       summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the       postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had       never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not       but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned       in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror,       Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth,       though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude;       and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating       to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as       soon as possible. But what is to be done about Pemberley? cried       Mrs. Gardiner. John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for       us; was it so? Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our       engagement. _That_ is all settled. That is all settled; repeated the other, as she ran into her       room to prepare. And are they upon such terms as for her to       disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was! But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her       in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth       been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that       all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but       she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst       the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at       Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour,       however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile       having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be       done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the       morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could       have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to       Longbourn.  Chapter 47 I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth, said her uncle,       as they drove from the town; and really, upon serious       consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as       your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very       unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a       girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was       actually staying in his colonels family, that I am strongly       inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would       not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the       regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His       temptation is not adequate to the risk! Do you really think so? cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a       moment. Upon my word, said Mrs. Gardiner, I begin to be of your       uncles opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,       honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so       very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him       up, as to believe him capable of it? Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other       neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so!       But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if       that had been the case? In the first place, replied Mr. Gardiner, there is no absolute       proof that they are not gone to Scotland. Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is       such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be       found on the Barnet road. Well, thensupposing them to be in London. They may be there,       though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional       purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on       either side; and it might strike them that they could be more       economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than       in Scotland. But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must       their marriage be private? Oh, no, nothis is not likely. His       most particular friend, you see by Janes account, was persuaded       of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a       woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims       has Lydiawhat attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good       humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of       benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the       apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a       dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I       know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But       as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.       Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from       my fathers behaviour, from his indolence and the little       attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in       his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little       about it, as any father could do, in such a matter. But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love       of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than       marriage? It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed, replied       Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, that a sisters sense of       decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,       really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her       justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to       think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a       twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement and       vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most       idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in       her way. Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton,       nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head.       She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and       talking on the subject, to give greaterwhat shall I call it?       susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively       enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person       and address that can captivate a woman. But you see that Jane, said her aunt, does not think so very       ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\nOf whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever       might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of       such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane       knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that       he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has       neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful       as he is insinuating. And do you really know all this? cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose       curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. I do indeed, replied Elizabeth, colouring. I told you, the       other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you       yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke       of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality       towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at       libertywhich it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about       the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss       Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,       disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must       know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found       her. But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what       you and Jane seem so well to understand? Oh, yes!that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and       saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel       Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I       returned home, the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or       fortnights time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I       related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our       knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any       one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him       should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that       Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her       eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be       in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such       a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was       far enough from my thoughts. When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason,       I suppose, to believe them fond of each other? Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on       either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you       must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be       thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready       enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near       Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months;       but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention;       and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and       wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the       regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her       favourites. It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could       be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this       interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could       detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From       Elizabeths thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the       keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval       of ease or forgetfulness. They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one       night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.       It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not       have been wearied by long expectations. The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were       standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;       and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise       that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their       whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first       pleasing earnest of their welcome. Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty       kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running       down from her mothers apartment, immediately met her. Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears       filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether       anything had been heard of the fugitives. Not yet, replied Jane. But now that my dear uncle is come, I       hope everything will be well. Is my father in town? Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word. And have you heard from him often? We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday       to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his       directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely       added that he should not write again till he had something of       importance to mention. And my motherhow is she? How are you all? My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are       greatly shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction       in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary       and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well. But youhow are you? cried Elizabeth. You look pale. How much       you must have gone through! Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and       their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.       Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to       by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and       aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles       and tears. When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which       Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the       others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to       give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence       of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still       expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would       bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain       their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage. Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few       minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be       expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives       against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her       own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to       whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must       principally be owing. If I had been able, said she, to carry my point in going to       Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but       poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the       Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was       some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the       kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked       after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge       of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And       now heres Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight       Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and       what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out       before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,       brother, I do not know what we shall do. They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,       after general assurances of his affection for her and all her       family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,       and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering       Lydia. Do not give way to useless alarm, added he; though it is right       to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it       as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a       few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know       that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not       let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I       shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to       Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what       is to be done. Oh! my dear brother, replied Mrs. Bennet, that is exactly what       I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find       them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married       already, _make_ them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not       let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much       money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And,       above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a       dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my witsand       have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over mesuch spasms       in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that       I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not       to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,       for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,       how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all. But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest       endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation       to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with       her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left       her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in       the absence of her daughters.\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no       real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not       attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence       enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited       at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household,       and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her       fears and solicitude on the subject. In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who       had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make       their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other       from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably       calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss       of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself       incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than       usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress       enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of       grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table: This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much       talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the       wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation. Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she       added, Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from       it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is       irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;       that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and       that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the       undeserving of the other sex. Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much       oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console       herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before       them. In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for       half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed       herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane       was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general       lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which       Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could       not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the       subject, by saying, But tell me all and everything about it       which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What       did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything       before the elopement took place? They must have seen them       together for ever. Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some       partiality, especially on Lydias side, but nothing to give him       any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive       and kind to the utmost. He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure       us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone       to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened       his journey. And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he       know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny       himself? Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing       anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion       about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not       marryingand from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have       been misunderstood before. And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you       entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married? How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I       felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness       with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not       been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of       that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then       owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest       of us, that in Lydias last letter she had prepared her for such       a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each       other, many weeks. But not before they went to Brighton? No, I believe not. And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?       Does he know his real character? I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he       formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.       And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he       left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false. Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of       him, this could not have happened! Perhaps it would have been better, replied her sister. But to       expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their       present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the       best intentions. Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydias note to       his wife? He brought it with him for us to see. Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.       These were the contents: My dear Harriet,       You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help       laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I       am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess       with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man       in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy       without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send       them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it       will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign       my name Lydia Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can       hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not       keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I       hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will       dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I       shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you       would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown       before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel       Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey. Your affectionate friend,       LYDIA BENNET. Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia! cried Elizabeth when she       had finished it. What a letter is this, to be written at such a       moment! But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the       subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade       her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor       father! how he must have felt it! I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for       full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the       whole house in such confusion! Oh! Jane, cried Elizabeth, was there a servant belonging to it       who did not know the whole story before the end of the day? I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a       time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I       endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid       I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what       might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties. Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not       look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care       and anxiety upon yourself alone. Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in       every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either       of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,       that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt       Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away;       and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of       great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very       kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us,       and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they       should be of use to us. She had better have stayed at home, cried Elizabeth; perhaps       she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one       cannot see too little of ones neighbours. Assistance is       impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at       a distance, and be satisfied. She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father       had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his       daughter. He meant I believe, replied Jane, to go to Epsom, the place       where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if       anything could be made out from them. His principal object must       be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them       from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he       thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing       from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make       enquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house       the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make       enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out       the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other       designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be       gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had       difficulty in finding out even so much as this.  Chapter 48\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the       next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line       from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a       most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time       they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he       had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of _that_ they       would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only       for the letters before he set off. When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving       constant information of what was going on, and their uncle       promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to       Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his       sister, who considered it as the only security for her husbands       not being killed in a duel. Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a       few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be       serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs.       Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of       freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and       always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening       them upthough, as she never came without reporting some fresh       instance of Wickhams extravagance or irregularity, she seldom       went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found       them. All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three       months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared       to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues,       all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into       every tradesmans family. Everybody declared that he was the       wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out       that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.       Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said,       believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin       more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it,       became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come       when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before       entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained       some news of them. Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife       received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he       had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come       to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and       Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory       information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the       principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they       might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London,       before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not       expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was       eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that       Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London       and promised to write again very soon. There was also a       postscript to this effect: I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if       possible, from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment,       whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be       likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself.       If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability       of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential       consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel       Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy       us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could       tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other       person. Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference       to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give       any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment       deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations,       except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many       years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in       the shire might be able to give more information; and though       she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a       something to look forward to. Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most       anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival       of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience.       Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be       communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some       news of importance. But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived       for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;       which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for       him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew       what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and       read it likewise. It was as follows: My dear Sir,       I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation       in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are       now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a       letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.       Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your       respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of       the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time       can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can       alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort you, under a       circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a       parents mind. The death of your daughter would have been a       blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be       lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte       informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your       daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;       though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and       Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must       be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity,       at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to       be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins,       but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have       related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this       false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of       all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself       condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?       And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with       augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for       had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your       sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console       yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child       from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of       her own heinous offense. I am, dear sir, etc., etc. Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer       from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant       nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single       relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was       certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances       had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did       not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any       of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as       likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his       own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in       addition to his fear of discovery by Lydias relations, for it       had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a       very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than       a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at       Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour       were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to       conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard       them with horror. A gamester! she cried. This is wholly       unexpected. I had not an idea of it. Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see       their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.       Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours,       he had yielded to his brother-in-laws entreaty that he would       return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion       might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When       Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much       satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her       anxiety for his life had been before. What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia? she cried.       Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is       to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away? As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that       she and the children should go to London, at the same time that       Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the       first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to       Longbourn.\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and       her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the       world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them       by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.       Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from       him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her       return that could come from Pemberley. The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse       for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore,       could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who       was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings,       was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she       could have borne the dread of Lydias infamy somewhat better. It       would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of       two. When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual       philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in       the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had       taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had       courage to speak of it. It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,       that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on       her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured,       he replied, Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself?       It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it. You must not be too severe upon yourself, replied Elizabeth. You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so       prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how       much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered       by the impression. It will pass away soon enough. Do you suppose them to be in London? Yes; where else can they be so well concealed? And Lydia used to want to go to London, added Kitty. She is happy then, said her father drily; and her residence       there will probably be of some duration. Then after a short silence he continued: Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice       to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some       greatness of mind. They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her       mothers tea. This is a parade, he cried, which does one good; it gives such       an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will       sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as       much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty       runs away. I am not going to run away, papa, said Kitty fretfully. If _I_       should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia. _You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as       Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to       be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is       ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the       village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up       with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors       till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day       in a rational manner. Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to       cry. Well, well, said he, do not make yourself unhappy. If you are       a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review       at the end of them.  Chapter 49 Two days after Mr. Bennets return, as Jane and Elizabeth were       walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the       housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to       call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead       of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to       Miss Bennet, I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but       I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I       took the liberty of coming to ask. What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town. Dear madam, cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, dont you       know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He       has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter. Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.       They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from       thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were       on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when       they were met by the butler, who said: If you are looking for my master, maam, he is walking towards       the little copse. Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall       once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was       deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of       the paddock. Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as       Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for       breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out: Oh, papa, what newswhat news? Have you heard from my uncle? Yes I have had a letter from him by express. Well, and what news does it bringgood or bad? What is there of good to be expected? said he, taking the       letter from his pocket. But perhaps you would like to read it. Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up. Read it aloud, said their father, for I hardly know myself       what it is about. Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August_ 2. My dear Brother,       At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such       as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon       after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out       in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till       we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen       them both           Then it is as I always hoped, cried Jane; they are           married! Elizabeth read on: I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find       there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to       perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your       side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is       required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,       her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your       children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,       moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during       your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions       which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying       with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall       send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me       your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,       that Mr. Wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are       generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that       respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money,       even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in       addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case,       you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole       of this business, I will immediately give directions to       Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be       the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore       stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.       Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write       explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be       married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She       comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more       is determined on. Yours, etc., EDW. GARDINER. Is it possible? cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. Can it       be possible that he will marry her? Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him, said       her sister. My dear father, I congratulate you. And have you answered the letter? cried Elizabeth. No; but it must be done soon. Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time       before he wrote. Oh! my dear father, she cried, come back and write       immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a       case. Let me write for you, said Jane, if you dislike the trouble       yourself. I dislike it very much, he replied; but it must be done. And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the       house. And may I ask said Elizabeth; but the terms, I suppose, must       be complied with. Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little. And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man! Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But       there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how       much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the       other, how am I ever to pay him. Money! My uncle! cried Jane, what do you mean, sir? I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight       a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty       after I am gone. That is very true, said Elizabeth; though it had not occurred       to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to       remain! Oh! it must be my uncles doings! Generous, good man, I       am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all       this. No, said her father; Wickhams a fool if he takes her with a       farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to       think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship. Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be       repaid?\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,       continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then       went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the       breakfast-room. And they are really to be married! cried Elizabeth, as soon as       they were by themselves. How strange this is! And for _this_ we       are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their       chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are       forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia! I comfort myself with thinking, replied Jane, that he       certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for       her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing       him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like       it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have       more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds? If he were ever able to learn what Wickhams debts have been,       said Elizabeth, and how much is settled on his side on our       sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for       them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness       of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her       home, and affording her their personal protection and       countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of       gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually       with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she       will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she       first sees my aunt! We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,       said Jane: I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His       consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is       come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will       steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,       and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past       imprudence forgotten. Their conduct has been such, replied Elizabeth, as neither       you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of       it. It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all       likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to       the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would       not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and,       without raising his head, coolly replied: Just as you please. May we take my uncles letter to read to her? Take whatever you like, and get away. Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went       up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:       one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight       preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet       could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr.       Gardiners hope of Lydias being soon married, her joy burst       forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She       was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever       been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter       would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her       felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct. My dear, dear Lydia! she cried. This is delightful indeed! She       will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at       sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he       would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear       Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write       to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run       down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay,       stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will       put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we       shall be together when we meet! Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the       violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the       obligations which Mr. Gardiners behaviour laid them all under. For we must attribute this happy conclusion, she added, in a       great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has       pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money. Well, cried her mother, it is all very right; who should do it       but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and       my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the       first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few       presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a       daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was       only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter,       that I am sure I cant write; so I will dictate, and you write       for me. We will settle with your father about the money       afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately. She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,       and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful       orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her       to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One days       delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother       was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,       too, came into her head. I will go to Meryton, said she, as soon as I am dressed, and       tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come       back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and       order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I       am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here       comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss       Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of       punch to make merry at her wedding. Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received       her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this       folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with       freedom. Poor Lydias situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it       was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and       though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor       worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in       looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she       felt all the advantages of what they had gained.  Chapter 50 Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life       that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an       annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his       wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had       he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been       indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now       be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of       the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband       might then have rested in its proper place. He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to       anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his       brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out       the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as       soon as he could. When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be       perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The       son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should       be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means       be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world,       but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years       after Lydias birth, had been certain that he would. This event       had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be       saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husbands       love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their       income. Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.       Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be       divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.       This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now       to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in       acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful       acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed       most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect       approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil       the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before       supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his       daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to       himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten       pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them;       for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual       presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands,       Lydias expenses had been very little within that sum. That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,       too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present       was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When       the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in       seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former       indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory       in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged       to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his       brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with       proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in       the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been       more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come       upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded       from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to       be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her       well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old       ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this       change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery       was considered certain. It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on       this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,       and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a       damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been       the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on       the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran       wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new       carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the       neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and,       without knowing or considering what their income might be,       rejected many as deficient in size and importance. Haye Park might do, said she, if the Gouldings could quit       itor the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;       but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten       miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful. Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the       servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her:       Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your       son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into       _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have       admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by       receiving them at Longbourn. A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was       firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with       amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea       to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should       receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.       Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be       carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse       his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would       scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She       was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must       reflect on her daughters nuptials, than to any sense of shame at       her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took       place. Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the       distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted       with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so       shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might       hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who       were not immediately on the spot. She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There       were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently       depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge       of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so muchnot,       however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to       herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between       them. Had Lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable       terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect       himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now       be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a       man whom he so justly scorned. From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.       The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself       of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation       survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved;       she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous       of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by       it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance       of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have       been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should       meet. What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that       the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago,       would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was       as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex;       but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph. She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in       disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding       and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her       wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of       both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been       softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement,       information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received       benefit of greater importance. But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude       what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different       tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon       to be formed in their family. How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable       independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent       happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together       because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could       easily conjecture. Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennets       acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his       eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and       concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be       mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was       to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the       militia. It was greatly my wish that he should do so, he added, as soon       as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me,       in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,       both on his account and my nieces. It is Mr. Wickhams intention       to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are       still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He       has the promise of an ensigncy in General s regiment, now       quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from       this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among       different people, where they may each have a character to       preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to       Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and       to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.       Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment,       for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the       trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in       Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his       information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he       has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will       be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless       they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.       Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before       she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully       remembered to you and her mother.Yours, etc., E. GARDINER. Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickhams       removal from the shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But       Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydias being       settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure       and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her       plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe       disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia       should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with       everybody, and had so many favourites. She is so fond of Mrs. Forster, said she, it will be quite       shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young       men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so       pleasant in General s regiment.\nHis daughters request, for such it might be considered, of being       admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,       received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,       who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sisters feelings       and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by       her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so       mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as       they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they       thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the       satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her       married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to       the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,       he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that       as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to       Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should       consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own       inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object       of her wishes.  Chapter 51 Their sisters wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt       for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was       sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it by       dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets,       and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would       have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, and was       wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to       receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the       carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably       grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy. Lydias voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown       open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards,       embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with       an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and       wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of       their happiness. Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was       not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;       and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young       couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was       disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia       still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned       from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when       at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took       notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a       laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there. Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his       manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his       marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy       address, while he claimed their relationship, would have       delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite       equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within       herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an       impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of       the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of       colour. There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could       neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to       sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in       that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very       unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have       the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was       recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects       which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world. Only think of its being three months, she cried, since I went       away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been       things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went       away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came       back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was. Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth       looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw       anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,       Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I       was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in       his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let       down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let       my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the       ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything. Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the       room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through       the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough       to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mothers right       hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, Ah! Jane, I take       your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married       woman. It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that       embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.       Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs.       Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to       hear herself called Mrs. Wickham by each of them; and in the       mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of       being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. Well, mamma, said she, when they were all returned to the       breakfast room, and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a       charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope       they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton.       That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we       did not all go. Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I       dont at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so? Oh, lord! yes;there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all       things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.       We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there       will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for       them all. I should like it beyond anything! said her mother. And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my       sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them       before the winter is over. I thank you for my share of the favour, said Elizabeth; but I       do not particularly like your way of getting husbands. Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr.       Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he       was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so       short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with       her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These       parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even       more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not. Wickhams affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had       expected to find it; not equal to Lydias for him. She had       scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the       reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the       strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have       wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope       with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was       rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were       the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of       having a companion. Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on       every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He       did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill       more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the       country. One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with       her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.       You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.       Are not you curious to hear how it was managed? No really, replied Elizabeth; I think there cannot be too       little said on the subject. La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We       were married, you know, at St. Clements, because Wickhams       lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should       all be there by eleven oclock. My uncle and aunt and I were to       go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,       Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,       you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I       should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the       time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she       was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in       ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I       longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\nWell, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would       never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my       uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with       them. If youll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of       doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme,       or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the       Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came       to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that       horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get       together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did       not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we       were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,       luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all       set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been       prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy       might have done as well. Mr. Darcy! repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement. Oh, yes!he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But       gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word       about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?       It was to be such a secret! If it was to be secret, said Jane, say not another word on the       subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further. Oh! certainly, said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;       we will ask you no questions. Thank you, said Lydia, for if you did, I should certainly tell       you all, and then Wickham would be angry. On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out       of her power, by running away. But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at       least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had       been at her sisters wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly       among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least       temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and       wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.       Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the       noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such       suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short       letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had       dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been       intended. You may readily comprehend, she added, what my curiosity must       be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and       (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have       been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me       understand itunless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in       the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must       endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance. Not that I _shall_, though, she added to herself, as she       finished the letter; and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in       an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and       stratagems to find it out. Janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to       Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was       glad of it;till it appeared whether her enquiries would receive       any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.  Chapter 52 Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her       letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in       possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she       was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the       benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter       convinced her that it did not contain a denial. Gracechurch Street, _Sept_. 6. My dear Niece, I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole       morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing       will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself       surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.       Dont think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know       that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_       side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my       impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I amand nothing       but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed       him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and       ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had       a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with       him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my       curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have       been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where       your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked       with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can       collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and       came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive       professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that       Wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it       impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in       him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and       confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his       private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for       itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and       endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.       If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace       him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to       discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which       was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another       reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago       governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on       some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She       then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since       maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he       knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for       intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or       three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would       not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption,       for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham       indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had       she been able to receive them into her house, they would have       taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind       friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in  street.       He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His       first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her       to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her       friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,       offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found       Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared       for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not       hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some       time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were       her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and       expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with       Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He       confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of       some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not       to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydias flight on her own       folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and       as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about       it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew       he should have nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.       Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have       been able to do something for him, and his situation must have       been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this       question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more       effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.       Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof       against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.       Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length       was reduced to be reasonable. Everything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcys next step       was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in       Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr.       Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further       enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town       the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person       whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore       readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the       former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was       only known that a gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at       home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk       together.\nThey met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not       all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was       sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I       fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,       after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times,       but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did       not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be       thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most       readily have settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which was more than       either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at       last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed       to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having       the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain;       and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great       pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him       of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.       But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at       most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the       young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to       considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in       addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission       purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone,       was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his       reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickhams       character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had       been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth       in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybodys_       reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all       this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured       that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him       credit for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends,       who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he       should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and       all money matters were then to receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation       which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least       it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and       Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was exactly       what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would       not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour       while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Janes letter       last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a       piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no       fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious       manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had       done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If       she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not       listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my       dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with       her. Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,       attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to       leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry       with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying       (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.       His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as       when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all       please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and       _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him. I       thought him very sly;he hardly ever mentioned your name. But       slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do       not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be       quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton,       with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this       half hour. Yours, very sincerely,       M. GARDINER. The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of       spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure       or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled       suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might       have been doing to forward her sisters match, which she had       feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be       probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain       of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be       true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on       himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a       research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman       whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to       meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe,       the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name       it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a       girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did       whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly       checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her       vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection       for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to       overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against       relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind       of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure,       done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a       reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch       of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been       wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it;       and though she would not place herself as his principal       inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality       for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of       mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly       painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who       could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia,       her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she       grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,       every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself       she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause       of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of       himself. She read over her aunts commendation of him again and       again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even       sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding       how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that       affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself. She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some ones       approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was       overtaken by Wickham. I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?       said he, as he joined her. You certainly do, she replied with a smile; but it does not       follow that the interruption must be unwelcome. I should be sorry indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good       friends; and now we are better. True. Are the others coming out? I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage       to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and       aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley. She replied in the affirmative. I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be       too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.       And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she       was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my       name to you. Yes, she did. And what did she say? That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid hadnot       turned out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things       are strangely misrepresented. Certainly, he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had       silenced him; but he soon afterwards said: I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each       other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there. Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh, said       Elizabeth. It must be something particular, to take him there at       this time of year. Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I       thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had. Yes; he introduced us to his sister. And do you like her? Very much. I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within       this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very       promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out       well. I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age. Did you go by the village of Kympton? I do not recollect that we did. I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have       had. A most delightful place!Excellent Parsonage House! It would       have suited me in every respect. How should you have liked making sermons?\nExceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my       duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought       not to repine;but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing       for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have       answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you       ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent? I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that       it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the       present patron. You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from       the first, you may remember. I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was       not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you       actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and       that the business had been compromised accordingly. You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may       remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of       it. They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked       fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sisters sake, to       provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile: Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not       let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be       always of one mind. She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry,       though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.  Chapter 53 Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation       that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear       sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was       pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet. The day of his and Lydias departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet       was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no       means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle,       was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth. Oh! my dear Lydia, she cried, when shall we meet again? Oh, lord! I dont know. Not these two or three years, perhaps. Write to me very often, my dear. As often as I can. But you know married women have never much       time for writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have       nothing else to do. Mr. Wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes.       He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things. He is as fine a fellow, said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were       out of the house, as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and       makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even       Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law. The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several       days. I often think, said she, that there is nothing so bad as       parting with ones friends. One seems so forlorn without them. This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a       daughter, said Elizabeth. It must make you better satisfied       that your other four are single. It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is       married, but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so       far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so       soon. But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was       shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of       hope, by an article of news which then began to be in       circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders       to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in       a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was       quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook       her head by turns. Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister, (for       Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). Well, so much the       better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us,       you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But,       however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes       it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us.       You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word       about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming? You may depend on it, replied the other, for Mrs. Nicholls was       in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself       on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was       certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very       likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butchers, she told me,       on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got       three couple of ducks just fit to be killed. Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without       changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his       name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together,       she said: I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the       present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But dont       imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the       moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure       you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or       pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we       shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but       I dread other peoples remarks. Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him       in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming       there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she       still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the       greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friends       permission, or being bold enough to come without it. Yet it is hard, she sometimes thought, that this poor man       cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without       raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself. In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be       her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could       easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were       more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them. The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their       parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again. As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear, said Mrs. Bennet,       you will wait on him of course. No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised,       if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it       ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fools errand       again. His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an       attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his       returning to Netherfield. Tis an _etiquette_ I despise, said he. If he wants our       society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not       spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they       go away and come back again. Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do       not wait on him. But, however, that shant prevent my asking him       to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the       Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there       will be just room at table for him. Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her       husbands incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that       her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it,       before _they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near, I begin to be sorry that he comes at all, said Jane to her       sister. It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect       indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually       talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one       can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be,       when his stay at Netherfield is over! I wish I could say anything to comfort you, replied Elizabeth;       but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the       usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied       me, because you have always so much. Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of       servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the       period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as       it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their       invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on       the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw       him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride       towards the house. Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane       resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy       her mother, went to the windowshe looked,she saw Mr. Darcy with       him, and sat down again by her sister. There is a gentleman with him, mamma, said Kitty; who can it       be? Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do       not know. La! replied Kitty, it looks just like that man that used to be       with him before. Mr. whats-his-name. That tall, proud man. Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!and so it does, I vow. Well, any       friend of Mr. Bingleys will always be welcome here, to be sure;       but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but       little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the       awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost       for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both       sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and       of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her       dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only       as Mr. Bingleys friend, without being heard by either of them.       But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be       suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew       Mrs. Gardiners letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment       towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she       had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own       more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole       family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she       regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at       least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her       astonishment at his comingat his coming to Netherfield, to       Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to       what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in       Derbyshire. The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half       a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added       lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that       his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would       not be secure. Let me first see how he behaves, said she; it will then be       early enough for expectation. She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without       daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them       to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the       door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than       Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemens appearing, her colour       increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a       propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of       resentment or any unnecessary complaisance. Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and       sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not       often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He       looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been       used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at       Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be       what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not       an improbable, conjecture. Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short       period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was       received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her       two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold       and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his       friend. Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the       latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from       irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful       degree by a distinction so ill applied. Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a       question which she could not answer without confusion, said       scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the       reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.       There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.       But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his       voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of       curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found       him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object       but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please,       than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was       disappointed, and angry with herself for being so. Could I expect it to be otherwise! said she. Yet why did he       come? She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;       and to him she had hardly courage to speak. She enquired after his sister, but could do no more. It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away, said Mrs.       Bennet. He readily agreed to it. I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People       _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;       but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have       happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is       married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you       have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It       was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put       in as it ought to be. It was only said, Lately, George Wickham,       Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet, without there being a syllable said       of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was       my brother Gardiners drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to       make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it? Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.       Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,       therefore, she could not tell. It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well       married, continued her mother, but at the same time, Mr.       Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.       They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it       seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His       regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving       the shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank       Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he       deserves. Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such       misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew       from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else       had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he       meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he       believed. When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley, said her       mother, I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you       please on Mr. Bennets manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy       to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you. Elizabeths misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious       attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had       flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would       be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant,       she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself       amends for moments of such painful confusion. The first wish of my heart, said she to herself, is never more       to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no       pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me       never see either one or the other again! Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no       compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from       observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the       admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had       spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be       giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she       had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though       not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should       be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she       talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that       she did not always know when she was silent. When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of       her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine       at Longbourn in a few days time. You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley, she added, for       when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family       dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you       see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did       not come back and keep your engagement. Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said       something of his concern at having been prevented by business.       They then went away. Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and       dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good       table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be       good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or       satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a       year.  Chapter 54 As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her       spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on       those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcys behaviour       astonished and vexed her. Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent, said       she, did he come at all? She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure. He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,       when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come       hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing,       teasing, man! I will think no more about him. Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the       approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look,       which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than       Elizabeth.\nNow, said she, that this first meeting is over, I feel       perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be       embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on       Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we       meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance. Yes, very indifferent indeed, said Elizabeth, laughingly. Oh,       Jane, take care. My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger       now? I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in       love with you as ever. They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.       Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy       schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley,       in half an hours visit, had revived. On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and       the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their       punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they       repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see       whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former       parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother,       occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by       herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane       happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He       placed himself by her. Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his       friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have       imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had       she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an       expression of half-laughing alarm. His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as       showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than       formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,       Janes happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though       she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received       pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the       animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no       cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the       table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She       knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either,       or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to       hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they       spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner       whenever they did. Her mothers ungraciousness, made the sense of       what they owed him more painful to Elizabeths mind; and she       would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him       that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of       the family. She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity       of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not       pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of       conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his       entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the       drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull       to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to       their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure       for the evening must depend. If he does not come to me, _then_, said she, I shall give him       up for ever. The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have       answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the       table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring       out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a       single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the       gentlemens approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her       than ever, and said, in a whisper: The men shant come and part us, I am determined. We want none       of them; do we? Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed       him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely       patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged       against herself for being so silly! A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish       enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the       sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second       proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to       their feelings! She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his       coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying: Is your sister at Pemberley still? Yes, she will remain there till Christmas. And quite alone? Have all her friends left her? Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to       Scarborough, these three weeks. She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to       converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her,       however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young       ladys whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away. When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the       ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined       by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a       victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players, and in a few       moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost       every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening       at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his       eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to       make him play as unsuccessfully as herself. Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to       supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of       the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them. Well girls, said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,       What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off       uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as       any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turnand everybody       said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times       better than what we had at the Lucases last week; and even Mr.       Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well       done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.       And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs.       Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what       do you think she said besides? Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have       her at Netherfield at last. She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long       is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very       pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them       prodigiously. Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen       enough of Bingleys behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she       would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her       family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that       she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next       day, to make his proposals. It has been a very agreeable day, said Miss Bennet to       Elizabeth. The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one       with the other. I hope we may often meet again. Elizabeth smiled. Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies       me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation       as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish       beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now       are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is       only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a       stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man. You are very cruel, said her sister, you will not let me       smile, and are provoking me to it every moment. How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in others! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I       acknowledge? That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all       love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth       knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not       make _me_ your confidante.  Chapter 55 A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.       His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to       return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and       was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine       with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed       himself engaged elsewhere. Next time you call, said she, I hope we shall be more lucky. He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if       she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of       waiting on them. Can you come to-morrow? Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her       invitation was accepted with alacrity. He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of       them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters room, in her       dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out: My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is comeMr. Bingley       is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come       to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never       mind Miss Lizzys hair. We will be down as soon as we can, said Jane; but I dare say       Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half       an hour ago. Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be       quick! Where is your sash, my dear?\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to       go down without one of her sisters. The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in       the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was       his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two       obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking       and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time,       without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not       observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently       said, What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me       for? What am I to do? Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you. She then sat       still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious       occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, Come here,       my love, I want to speak to you, took her out of the room. Jane       instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at       such premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in       to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and       called out: Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you. Elizabeth was forced to go. We may as well leave them by themselves you know; said her       mother, as soon as she was in the hall. Kitty and I are going up       stairs to sit in my dressing-room. Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained       quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then       returned into the drawing-room. Mrs. Bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was       every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her       daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable       addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged       officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with       a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to       the daughter. He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he       went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and       Mrs. Bennets means, for his coming next morning to shoot with       her husband. After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word       passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went       to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded,       unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,       however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have       taken place with that gentlemans concurrence. Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet       spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was       much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was       nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his       ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more       communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen       him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the       evening Mrs. Bennets invention was again at work to get every       body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter       to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon       after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards,       she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes. But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was       finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to       fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening       the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together       over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had       this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily       turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it       all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought       was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and       Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who       as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering       a few words to her sister, ran out of the room. Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence       would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,       with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in       the world. Tis too much! she added, by far too much. I do not deserve       it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy? Elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity, a       warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every       sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But       she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half       that remained to be said for the present. I must go instantly to my mother; she cried. I would not on       any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her       to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father       already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give       such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much       happiness! She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up       the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty. Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity       and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given       them so many previous months of suspense and vexation. And this, said she, is the end of all his friends anxious       circumspection! of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance!       the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end! In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with       her father had been short and to the purpose. Where is your sister? said he hastily, as he opened the door. With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare       say. He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good       wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily       expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They       shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came       down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own       happiness, and of Janes perfections; and in spite of his being a       lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity       to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the       excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane,       and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and       himself. It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the       satisfaction of Miss Bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet       animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.       Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.       Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation       in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked       to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet       joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how       really happy he was. Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till       their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was       gone, he turned to his daughter, and said: Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman. Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his       goodness. You are a good girl; he replied, and I have great pleasure in       thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of       your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means       unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever       be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and       so generous, that you will always exceed your income. I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters       would be unpardonable in _me_. Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet, cried his wife, what       are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and       very likely more. Then addressing her daughter, Oh! my dear,       dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shant get a wink of sleep       all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so,       at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I       remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into       Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you       should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that       ever was seen! Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition       her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her       younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects       of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense. Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and       Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter. Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at       Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always       remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous       neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an       invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept. Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her       sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow       on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both       of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.       In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth,       for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone,       Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\nHe has made me so happy, said she, one evening, by telling me       that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I       had not believed it possible. I suspected as much, replied Elizabeth. But how did he account       for it? It must have been his sisters doing. They were certainly no       friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,       since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many       respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their       brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we       shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once       were to each other. That is the most unforgiving speech, said Elizabeth, that I       ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see       you again the dupe of Miss Bingleys pretended regard. Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last       November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of       _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down       again! He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of       his modesty. This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his       diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good       qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed       the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most       generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a       circumstance which must prejudice her against him. I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!       cried Jane. Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and       blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there       were but such another man for you! If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy       as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can       have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and,       perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.       Collins in time. The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be       long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.       Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the       same by all her neighbours in Meryton. The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in       the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first       run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for       misfortune.  Chapter 56 One morning, about a week after Bingleys engagement with Jane       had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting       together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn       to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a       chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the       morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to       that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and       neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded       it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that       somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet       to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with       him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of       the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,       till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was       Lady Catherine de Bourgh. They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their       astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of       Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them,       even inferior to what Elizabeth felt. She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,       made no other reply to Elizabeths salutation than a slight       inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.       Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships       entrance, though no request of introduction had been made. Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of       such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.       After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to       Elizabeth, I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your       mother. Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was. And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters. Yes, madam, said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady       Catherine. She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all       is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,       walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part       of the family. You have a very small park here, returned Lady Catherine after       a short silence. It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but       I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucass. This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,       in summer; the windows are full west. Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,       and then added: May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left       Mr. and Mrs. Collins well. Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last. Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her       from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her       calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled. Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take       some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not       very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,       said to Elizabeth, Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little       wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a       turn in it, if you will favour me with your company. Go, my dear, cried her mother, and show her ladyship about the       different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage. Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,       attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the       hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and       drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be       decent looking rooms, walked on. Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her       waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the       gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to       make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more       than usually insolent and disagreeable. How could I ever think her like her nephew? said she, as she       looked in her face. As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the       following manner: You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of       my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell       you why I come. Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment. Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to       account for the honour of seeing you here. Miss Bennet, replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, you ought       to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere       _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character       has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in       a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from       it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I       was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most       advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet,       would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew,       my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous       falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose       the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for       this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you. If you believed it impossible to be true, said Elizabeth,       colouring with astonishment and disdain, I wonder you took the       trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by       it? At once to insist upon having such a report universally       contradicted. Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family, said       Elizabeth coolly, will be rather a confirmation of it; if,       indeed, such a report is in existence. If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been       industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such       a report is spread abroad? I never heard that it was. And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for       it? I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.       _You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer. This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being       satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage? Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible. It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of       his reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of       infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to       all his family. You may have drawn him in. If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it. Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to       such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in       the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns. But you are not entitled to know _mine;_ nor will such behaviour       as this, ever induce me to be explicit. Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the       presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy       is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?\nOnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose       he will make an offer to me. Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied: The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their       infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the       favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in       their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when       the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their       marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of       no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do       you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit       engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of       propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his       earliest hours he was destined for his cousin? Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there       is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall       certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt       wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you       could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on       others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination       confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And       if I am that choice, why may not I accept him? Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.       Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by       his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the       inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and       despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a       disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us. These are heavy misfortunes, replied Elizabeth. But the wife       of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness       necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the       whole, have no cause to repine. Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your       gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to       me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss       Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of       carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not       been used to submit to any persons whims. I have not been in the       habit of brooking disappointment. _That_ will make your ladyships situation at present more       pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_. I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and       my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the       maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the fathers,       from respectable, honourable, and ancientthough       untitledfamilies. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They       are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their       respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart       pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or       fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If       you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit       the sphere in which you have been brought up. In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as       quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentlemans       daughter; so far we are equal. True. You _are_ a gentlemans daughter. But who was your mother?       Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of       their condition. Whatever my connections may be, said Elizabeth, if your nephew       does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_. Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him? Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady       Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say,       after a moments deliberation: I am not. Lady Catherine seemed pleased. And will you promise me, never to enter into such an       engagement? I will make no promise of the kind. Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a       more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a       belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have       given me the assurance I require. And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be       intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship       wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you       the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more       probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing       to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?       Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which       you have supported this extraordinary application have been as       frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely       mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such       persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your       interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have       certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,       therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject. Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the       objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I       am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters       infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young mans marrying       her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and       uncles. And is _such_ a girl to be my nephews sister? Is _her_       husband, who is the son of his late fathers steward, to be his       brother? Heaven and earth!of what are you thinking? Are the       shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted? You can _now_ have nothing further to say, she resentfully       answered. You have insulted me in every possible method. I must       beg to return to the house. And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they       turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed. You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my       nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a       connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody? Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my       sentiments. You are then resolved to have him? I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that       manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,       without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly       unconnected with me. It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey       the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to       ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the       contempt of the world. Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude, replied Elizabeth,       have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No       principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr.       Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the       indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his       marrying me, it would not give me one moments concernand the       world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn. And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very       well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet,       that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I       hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry       my point. In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the       door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, I       take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your       mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously       displeased. Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her       ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it       herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up       stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the       dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again       and rest herself. She did not choose it, said her daughter, she would go. She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was       prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the       Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say,       and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call       on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you,       Lizzy? Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to       acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.  Chapter 57\nThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw       Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for       many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady       Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this       journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her       supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to       be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could       originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she       recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and       _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the       expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to       supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the       marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.       And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their       communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had       reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost       certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as       possible at some future time. In revolving Lady Catherines expressions, however, she could not       help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of       her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of       her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to       Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;       and how he might take a similar representation of the evils       attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She       knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his       dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he       thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it       was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with       _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own,       his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions       of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to       Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good       sense and solid reasoning. If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had       often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a       relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to       be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case       he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way       through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to       Netherfield must give way. If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come       to his friend within a few days, she added, I shall know how to       understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every       wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting       me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall       soon cease to regret him at all. The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their       visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied       it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.       Bennets curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on       the subject. The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her       father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand. Lizzy, said he, I was going to look for you; come into my       room. She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had       to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in       some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck       her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated       with dismay all the consequent explanations. She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat       down. He then said, I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me       exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to       know its contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_       daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a       very important conquest. The colour now rushed into Elizabeths cheeks in the       instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,       instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be       pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his       letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father       continued: You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such       matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to       discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr.       Collins. From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say? Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with       congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest       daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the       good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your       impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates       to yourself, is as follows: Having thus offered you the sincere       congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event,       let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which       we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter       Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet,       after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of       her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most       illustrious personages in this land. Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? This young       gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the       heart of mortal can most desire,splendid property, noble       kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these       temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of       what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this       gentlemans proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to       take immediate advantage of. Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it       comes out: My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to       imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on       the match with a friendly eye. _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_       surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man       within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have       given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy,       who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who       probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable! Elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry, but could       only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been       directed in a manner so little agreeable to her. Are you not diverted? Oh! yes. Pray read on. After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her       ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual       condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it       became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on       the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what       she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give       the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her       noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run       hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.       Mr. Collins moreover adds, I am truly rejoiced that my cousin       Lydias sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only       concerned that their living together before the marriage took       place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect       the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement       at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as       soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and       had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously       have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a       Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their       names to be mentioned in your hearing. _That_ is his notion of       Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his       dear Charlottes situation, and his expectation of a young       olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.       You are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be       affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make       sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn? Oh! cried Elizabeth, I am excessively diverted. But it is so       strange! Yes_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other       man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference,       and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much       as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collinss       correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter       of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over       Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my       son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this       report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as       it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not       distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at       a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was       necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father       had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcys       indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want       of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too       _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.  Chapter 58 Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,       as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to       bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed       after Lady Catherines visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and,       before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his       aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who       wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It       was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary       could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.       Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip       them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were       to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty       was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly       forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the       same. They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call       upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a       general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him       alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and,       while her courage was high, she immediately said: Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of       giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be       wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your       unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known       it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully       I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not       have merely my own gratitude to express. I am sorry, exceedingly sorry, replied Darcy, in a tone of       surprise and emotion, that you have ever been informed of what       may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not       think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted. You must not blame my aunt. Lydias thoughtlessness first       betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of       course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me       thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that       generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble,       and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering       them. If you _will_ thank me, he replied, let it be for yourself       alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force       to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to       deny. But your _family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I       believe I thought only of _you_. Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short       pause, her companion added, You are too generous to trifle with       me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me       so at once. _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one       word from you will silence me on this subject for ever. Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and       anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and       immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand       that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the       period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude       and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this       reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before;       and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as       warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had       Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how       well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face,       became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and       he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she       was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable. They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too       much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any       other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their       present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_       call on him in her return through London, and there relate her       journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her       conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every       expression of the latter which, in her ladyships apprehension,       peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief       that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that       promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But,       unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly       contrariwise. It taught me to hope, said he, as I had scarcely ever allowed       myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be       certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided       against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine,       frankly and openly. Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, Yes, you know       enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After       abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple       in abusing you to all your relations. What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your       accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my       behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It       was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence. We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to       that evening, said Elizabeth. The conduct of neither, if       strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we       have both, I hope, improved in civility. I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of       what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions       during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,       inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I       shall never forget: had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike       manner. Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely       conceive, how they have tortured me;though it was some time, I       confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice. I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong       an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever       felt in such a way. I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every       proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I       shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed       you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me. Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not       do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily       ashamed of it. Darcy mentioned his letter. Did it, said he, did it soon make       you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit       to its contents? She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually       all her former prejudices had been removed. I knew, said he, that what I wrote must give you pain, but it       was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was       one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your       having the power of reading again. I can remember some       expressions which might justly make you hate me. The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential       to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason       to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I       hope, quite so easily changed as that implies. When I wrote that letter, replied Darcy, I believed myself       perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was       written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit. The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.       The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The       feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it,       are now so widely different from what they were then, that every       unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You       must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its       remembrance gives you pleasure.\nI cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_       retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the       contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is       much better, of innocence. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful       recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be       repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,       though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was       _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given       good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.       Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), I was       spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,       particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed,       encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to       care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all       the rest of the world; to _wish_ at least to think meanly of       their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from       eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but       for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You       taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.       By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of       my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my       pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased. Had you then persuaded yourself that I should? Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you       to be wishing, expecting my addresses. My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I       assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might       often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_       evening? Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began       to take a proper direction. I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met       at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming? No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise. Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed       by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary       politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_       than my due. My object _then_, replied Darcy, was to show you, by every       civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the       past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill       opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended       to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly       tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you. He then told her of Georgianas delight in her acquaintance, and       of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally       leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that       his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her       sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his       gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other       struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend. She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a       subject to each, to be dwelt on farther. After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy       to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their       watches, that it was time to be at home. What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane! was a wonder which       introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted       with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest       information of it. I must ask whether you were surprised? said Elizabeth. Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen. That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as       much. And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had       been pretty much the case. On the evening before my going to London, said he, I made a       confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.       I told him of all that had occurred to make my former       interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise       was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him,       moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had       done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could       easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt       no doubt of their happiness together. Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing       his friend. Did you speak from your own observation, said she, when you       told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information       last spring? From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two       visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her       affection. And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate       conviction to him. It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had       prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case,       but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to       confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended       him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had       been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and       purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am       persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your       sisters sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now. Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most       delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was       invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had       yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to       begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course       was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation       till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.  Chapter 59 My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to? was a       question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she       entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to       table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered       about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she       spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion       of the truth. The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.       The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged       were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness       overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather       _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for,       besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils       before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when       her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him       but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_       which not all his fortune and consequence might do away. At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very       far from Miss Bennets general habits, she was absolutely       incredulous here. You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!engaged to Mr. Darcy! No,       no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible. This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on       you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.       Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He       still loves me, and we are engaged. Jane looked at her doubtingly. Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know       how much you dislike him. You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot.       Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in       such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the       last time I shall ever remember it myself. Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more       seriously assured her of its truth. Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,       cried Jane. My dear, dear Lizzy, I wouldI do congratulate       youbut are you certain? forgive the questionare you quite       certain that you can be happy with him? There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already,       that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you       pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother? Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself       more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as       impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh,       Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you       quite sure that you feel what you ought to do? Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do,       when I tell you all. What do you mean? Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I       am afraid you will be angry. My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very       seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without       delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him? It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it       began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his       beautiful grounds at Pemberley. Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the       desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn       assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss       Bennet had nothing further to wish.\nNow I am quite happy, said she, for you will be as happy as       myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his       love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as       Bingleys friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and       yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very       reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at       Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,       not to you. Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been       unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own       feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But       now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydias       marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in       conversation. Good gracious! cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the       next morning, if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here       again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so       tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he       would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us       with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk       out with him again, that he may not be in Bingleys way. Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;       yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him       such an epithet. As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,       and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good       information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, Mrs. Bennet,       have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way       again to-day? I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty, said Mrs. Bennet, to       walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and       Mr. Darcy has never seen the view. It may do very well for the others, replied Mr. Bingley; but I       am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wont it, Kitty? Kitty       owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great       curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently       consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet       followed her, saying: I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that       disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind       it: it is all for Janes sake, you know; and there is no occasion       for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put       yourself to inconvenience. During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennets consent       should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved       to herself the application for her mothers. She could not       determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting       whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome       her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set       against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain       that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her       sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the       first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her       disapprobation. In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,       she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on       seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her fathers opposition,       but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be       through her meansthat _she_, his favourite child, should be       distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears       and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched reflection, and       she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at       him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he       approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while       pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, Go to your       father, he wants you in the library. She was gone directly. Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.       Lizzy, said he, what are you doing? Are you out of your       senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him? How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been       more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have       spared her from explanations and professions which it was       exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she       assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy. Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich,       to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages       than Jane. But will they make you happy? Have you any other objection, said Elizabeth, than your belief       of my indifference? None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of       man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him. I do, I do like him, she replied, with tears in her eyes, I       love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly       amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain       me by speaking of him in such terms. Lizzy, said her father, I have given him my consent. He is the       kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,       which he condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are       resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of       it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be       neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your       husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively       talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal       marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My       child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to       respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about. Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her       reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was       really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change       which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute       certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had       stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with       energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her fathers       incredulity, and reconcile him to the match. Well, my dear, said he, when she ceased speaking, I have no       more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not       have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy. To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.       Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with       astonishment. This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every       thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellows       debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will       save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncles       doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young       lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him       to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and       there will be an end of the matter. He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his       reading Mr. Collinss letter; and after laughing at her some       time, allowed her at last to gosaying, as she quitted the room,       If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am       quite at leisure. Elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,       after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room, she was       able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was       too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away;       there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the       comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time. When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she       followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect       was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat       quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under       many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard;       though not in general backward to credit what was for the       advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to       any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in       her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself. Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!       Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest       Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what       jewels, what carriages you will have! Janes is nothing to       itnothing at all. I am so pleasedso happy. Such a charming       man!so handsome! so tall!Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for       my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook       it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is       charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!       What will become of me. I shall go distracted. This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be       doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard       only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three       minutes in her own room, her mother followed her. My dearest child, she cried, I can think of nothing else! Ten       thousand a year, and very likely more! Tis as good as a Lord!       And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special       licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is       particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.\nThis was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the       gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in       the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of       her relations consent, there was still something to be wished       for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for       Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law       that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power       to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his       opinion. Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains       to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that       he was rising every hour in his esteem. I admire all my three sons-in-law highly, said he. Wickham,       perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband       quite as well as Janes.  Chapter 60 Elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted       Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.       How could you begin? said she. I can comprehend your going on       charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could       set you off in the first place? I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the       words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in       the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun. My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my mannersmy       behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil,       and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain       than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence? For the liveliness of your mind, I did. You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little       less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference,       of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who       were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_       approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so       unlike _them_. Had you not been really amiable, you would have       hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise       yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your       heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously       courted you. ThereI have saved you the trouble of accounting for       it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it       perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of       mebut nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love. Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while       she was ill at Netherfield? Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a       virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your       protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;       and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing       and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin       directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the       point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called,       and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did       you look as if you did not care about me? Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no       encouragement. But I was embarrassed. And so was I. You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner. A man who had felt less, might. How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,       and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder       how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to       yourself. I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not       asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to       Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too much_, I am afraid; for       what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach       of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This       will never do. You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly       fair. Lady Catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us       were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for       my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your       gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of       yours. My aunts intelligence had given me hope, and I was       determined at once to know every thing. Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her       happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come       down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and       be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious       consequence? My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could,       whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or       what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were       still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession       to him which I have since made. Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what       is to befall her? I am more likely to want  time than courage, Elizabeth. But it       ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it       shall be done directly. And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you       and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady       once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer       neglected. From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.       Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.       Gardiners long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate       which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to       find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of       happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to       have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of       particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You       supposed more than really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as       you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your       imagination in every possible flight which the subject will       afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot       greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a       great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and       again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to       wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round       the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world.       Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such       justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.       Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare       from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours,       etc. Mr. Darcys letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;       and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr.       Collins, in reply to his last. Dear Sir,       I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will       soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as       you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has       more to give. Yours sincerely, etc. Miss Bingleys congratulations to her brother, on his approaching       marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote       even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat       all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but       she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could       not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was       deserved. The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar       information, was as sincere as her brothers in sending it. Four       sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and       all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister. Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any       congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family       heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The       reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine       had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her       nephews letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match,       was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a       moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to       Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must       sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.       Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her       husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could       even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on       carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed       his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. Jamess, with       very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not       till Sir William was out of sight.", "mentions": [[1217, 1235, "Mr. Bennet"], [1242, 1245, "Mr. Bennet"], [1254, 1257, "Mr. Bennet"], [1272, 1275, "Mr.
